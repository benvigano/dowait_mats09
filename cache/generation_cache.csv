039b4f7d4561f7211aab6373635ae609,What is 2 + 3?,"To solve this, I need to understand the basic principles of addition. Addition is combining two numbers to find the total. So, 2 + 3 means I have two objects and then add three more. Let me visualize this. I have two apples, and someone gives me three more apples. How many apples do I have now? Wait, no, that's more than the problem says. Let me think again. The problem is 2 + 3. So, two plus three. Let me count on my fingers. Starting with two, then adding three more. So, one, two, three, four, five. Hmm, that seems too many. Wait, no, that's just 2 + 3. Maybe I should break it down. 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2 because addition is commutative. So, maybe I can count three and add two. Starting with three, then adding two: one, two, three, four. Wait, that's four again. That doesn't sound right. Maybe I'm confusing with multiplication. No, addition is about combining, not multiplying. Hmm, let me try a different approach. I know that 2 plus 2 is 4. So, 2 plus 3 should be one more than that, which is 5. Yeah, that makes sense. So, 2 + 3 equals 5. I think that's the correct answer.

**Step-by-step explanation:**
To solve the addition problem 2 + 3, start by understanding that addition involves combining two numbers to find the total. First, add 2 and 3 together. Counting on from 2, you add 3 more: 3, 4, 5. Therefore, 2 + 3 equals 5.

**Solution:**

To solve the addition problem \(2 + 3\), follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem:** Addition involves combining two numbers to find the total. Here, we have \(2 + 3\).

2. **Count on from the first number:** Start with the number 2 and add 3 to it.

   - Count 1 (2 + 1 = 3)
   - Count 2 (3 + 1 = 4)
   - Count 3 (4 + 1 = 5)

3. **Result:** After adding 3 to 2, the total is 5.
