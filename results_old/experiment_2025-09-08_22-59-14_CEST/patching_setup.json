Let me think about how these absolute values work here.\n\nFirst off, each term inside an absolute value represents a distance on the number line from x to another point (like 1, 1.5, or 2 in this case). So essentially, we're trying to minimize the total distance from some point x to three fixed points at positions 1, 1.5, and 2.\n\nI remember that for such problems involving minimizing sums of distances like this, there's something called the median which often gives you the minimal total distance when dealing with even numbers of data points... Wait no, actually it depends whether they are odd or not? Or maybe more precisely, if all weights are equal as in our case since every weight contributes equally—so perhaps any single point between two middle terms would give us the same result?\n\nWait let me clarify:\n\nWhen considering minimization over real numbers of expressions like Σ|x - ai| where ai are given constants, then yes, the solution tends towards one of the medians among those ai’s because moving away beyond certain points increases the individual contributions but might decrease others depending on their position relative to other points.\n\nSo first thing comes mind—if my set has only three points—the ones being subtracted—are arranged symmetrically around a central point—I can probably just pick somewhere near them without having too much trouble finding the optimal x.\n\nBut wait, hold on—isn't the function made up of linear segments connected at different breakpoints—in particular, whenever x crosses into regions defined by consecutive pairs of the ai's—it changes its slope accordingly—but overall, regardless of what happens before breaking down, the minima should occur either exactly at one of the breakpoints themselves or possibly anywhere else within intervals bounded by adjacent breakpoint locations.\n\nTherefore, instead of looking blindly through calculus methods, especially partial derivatives—which may complicate things due to piecewise nature—we could consider using geometry concepts related to reflections—for example, reflecting across lines—and see where the path intersects again—or use properties similar to Fermat-Torricelli problem regarding balancing forces along directions perpendiculars...\n\nAlternatively, thinking visually, plotting y versus x graphically will show V-shaped functions connecting at various critical points; thus identifying key turning points helps pinpointing potential candidates for extrema.\n\nLet me try both approaches mentally.\n\nApproach One: Calculus\n\nIf I take derivative of S w.r.t.x,\n\ndS/dx= d/dx[ |x-1| ]+d/dx [|x−1.5|] +d/dx[ |x−2| ]\n\nEach term individually breaks apart based on sign:\nFor |x-a|,\nif x >a : deriv is 1\nelse if x <a : deriv is −1\nand equals zero otherwise.\nThus, putting together, the entire derivative becomes adding signs according to current location of x compared to each ai.\n\nHence, setting derivative to zero requires solving equations where cumulative positive slopes balance negative ones.\n\nHowever, handling multiple cases seems cumbersome unless structured properly.\n\nGiven symmetry isn’t perfect though—as the gaps aren't uniform—all right, except between 1 & 1.5 is half unit gap, while next after 1.5&2 also half units—that makes sense why sometimes people say \"median\" applies best here.\n\nIn fact, generally speaking, for n variables sorted increasingly, the median provides the minimal sum of absolute deviations.\n\n Wait.
