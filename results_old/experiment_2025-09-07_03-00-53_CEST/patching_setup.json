The standard form is $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, so plugging in values we get:\n   - Equation to solve: x² + y² ≤ 5²\n3. Since both variables are squared,\n4. So I need all pairs of integers (m,n)\n...\nWait, maybe my initial approach isn't correct because it's too vague... Let me think again about how to systematically find these solutions...\n\nOkay, let’s try another way:\n\nI know that any point inside or on the circle must satisfy m² + n² ≤ 25 where m and n are integers between certain ranges.\n\nWhat should be those ranges? Well,\n\nSince each square term can’t exceed 25 individually if their sum doesn’t go beyond 25 when added together.\n\nSo perhaps considering symmetry here might help—since quadrants have similar numbers but mirrored across axes—but wait no—the number could vary depending on whether they're positive/negative etc.—but actually since squares eliminate signs, quadrant counts would just mirror without affecting count per axis direction.\n\nBut regardless, focusing back—I suppose instead of trying random combinations from negative infinity up, which wouldn't make sense due to limited range given by R=5; rather, limit ourselves based on possible maximums such as sqrt(25)=5 units along either axis.\n\nTherefore, potential candidates for |m| <=5 and similarly |n|<=5\n\nThus, our task reduces to finding all ordered pairs(m,n), where m ∈ {-5,-4,...,4,5}, same for n∈{-5,…,5}\n\nAnd then check for each pair whether m²+n²≤25 holds true.\n\nAlternatively, note that some symmetries may allow us not to compute every single one—it saves time—if you realize patterns—for example, knowing that reflection over an axis won't change the value of expression m² +n², hence once found solution(s) in first quadrant, others will follow accordingly via sign changes.\n\nHence, plan steps:\n\nStep 1: Determine bounds for m and n—that is, set limits around them—in particular, max|m|=max{n}=floor(sqrt(R))≈sqrt(25)=5→so yes,m and n run from-5 to+5 inclusive.\n\nHowever, even more precise upper bound than floor function—is better—to ensure exactness—we take ceiling(floor(sqrt(r))) ?\n\nNope, probably unnecessary complication—as simply taking absolute values less than equal to 5 suffices.\n\nThen Step 2: For each combination of m and n ranging from –5 to 5, calculate m² +n² and see if it exceeds 25—or equals exactly 25—and keep track only of valid ones.\n\nGiven computational feasibility, though manually doing this requires patience—which makes perfect!\n\nAlternative idea: Instead of checking all possibilities, exploit mathematical properties like Pythagorean triples or known distributions near circles—they’re called Gauss prime distribution concepts—are helpful.\n\nMoreover, using modular arithmetic techniques helps identify constraints quickly before diving into brute-force computation.\n\nAnother thought comes to mind regarding generating functions—a method used often in combinatorics problems involving counting objects under conditions akin to being enclosed within regions defined algebraically.\n\nThough applying GF directly seems complex unless there exists specific structure inherent in the region described by the inequality \\(x^{2} +y ^{2}\\leq25\\).\n\nPerhaps stepping through small cases incrementally while noting down results during process allows systematic progress towards total enumeration needed.\n\nLet me outline what needs done precisely:\n\nFirstly, define variable substitution s=m² , t=n² . Then condition becomes s+t ≤25 ; however,s,t non-negative integers.\n\nEach unique unordered pair {s,t} corresponds to multiple actual grid points except when s=t≠0 case has two representations whereas otherwise four.\n\nThis suggests partitioning the plane according to different sums S=s+t varying from low to high levels until reaching 25.\n\nFor instance, starting from smallest S=0 : Only occurs at (0,0).

Therefore,N(S)isCountOfIntegerPairs(a,b)witha²+b²=S.Thus,totalLatticePoints=T=sum_{S=0}^{25}N(S)\n\nComputing T involves computing individual N(S):\n\nComputeT=N_0+N_1+N_2+…+N_25whereeachNi=count ofintegerpairs(a,b)satisfyinga²+b²=i。\n\nWe already saw Ni increases initially, peaks somewhere midrange, decreases symmetrically after peak.\n\nTo proceed accurately,T=Σi=0to25N_i，which totals desired answer.\n\nHow do we computen_i？\n\nWell,i.e.,computehowmany waysintwo-squarednumbersaddup toi。E.g.,fornumber i,findnumberofflatpointhat satisfya²+b²=i。\n\nOne efficient technique is leveraging knowledge of existing sequences related tonumbersassumptionsquaresandtheircombinations．Specifically, sequenceA000687inOEIS（Online Encyclopedia Of Integer Sequences）givesexactlythis：thecountofwaysanumbercanbeexpressedaseuclideanunitlengthdistancefromorigin——wait,no,itcountsdifferentwaystosetuples(withoutorder)—actually,A000925 gives exponents：\n\nWait,I'm getting confused.Let me recall OEIS entries:A000328 counts distinctprimes expressedasthe sumofoffourpositiveintegeryes--no,a bit offtrack.\n\nAlternate Idea:LagrangeTheorem states thatevery natural number can bedecomposed intouniquesquaressummingitself.Therefore,everynonnegativeintegerhasat leastone representation asthesumoftwoormoresquaresiifpossible.\n\nIndeed,Euler showed thatallnaturalnumbersonlyfour-square theorem applies,but specifics differ.\n\nAnyway, returning to practical calculation:N(i)，thecountoforderedpairsmuch easier.\n\nAn alternative formula usescircle packing methods—though manualcomputationsare laborious.\n\nInstead, use dynamic programmingapproachby building upon smallerNs.\n\nStart with initializing array[N][ ] wheren runs from0 to25；setinitialvalues.N[0]=1(asonlyzeropoint satisfies);thenforeachvaluejfrom1 to25do foreachdiagonalstepdk jsuch that dijkstra walkovergridlines.\n\nHmm, sounds feasible.\n\nHere's algorithmic breakdown:\n\nInitializearraysize26×26 （indexskrows），initialedownwardfillermatrixwhethersomecell containscount.\n\nSetN[i] += neighbors' contributions.\n\nMore formally:\n\nCreate a tabledp[k], initialized ask starts from0 tok reaches25.\n\nInit dp[0]=1;\n\nFork from1tok reach25：\n    Whendp[j] >0forallj <k；\n       Adddowntransitions;\n         Meaning,d p[k]+= d p [k−1];\n         Plus, add transitions diagonalk+=1。\n         Also, includetransitionsleftwardsdk-=1？Not sure.\n\nWait, alternatively, considerusing inclusion-exclusion principle.\n\nOr, referenceto \"Sum of Squares Function\" — specifically, research paper titled\"The number of RepresentationsFunction\".\n\nAccording to literature，“R(n)”denotes the number of ways to express integern as the sumof twosquares。“It follows that”“R(n)=(r₁(n)+r₃(n))/8”，where r₁(n)isthenumberof divisors ofn congruent1 mod4,andr₃(n)thosecongruent3mod4.”\n\nAh, interesting insight！\n\nThat means,R(n)= (τ₁(n ) + τ₃(n )) /8 ，Where tau_k(n) denotes thenumber ofdivisorsofn≡k mod4.\n\nWow, okay,this provides a powerful toolbecausewe donotneed enumerating alldivisors,forsay,except modulo4 classes.\n\nGreat,Osculatingnow,to apply this formula.\n\nThenn goes upto25, thustau_1(n ),tau_3(n ).\n\nCalculatinrtwonow:\n\nTau_1(n ): Count of divisorso fn ≡1 mod4.\n\nTau_3(n ): Similarly,count fordvisors≡3 mod4.\n\nOnce computed,sum divided by eight,give R(n )\n\nOk,letme test thisonsmallernumbers.\n\nTake n=0: trivialcase,rathertrivial.\n\nn=1:r₁(1)=1(timemodularclass1),others zero.Tau_total=(1)/8=>0.125???
