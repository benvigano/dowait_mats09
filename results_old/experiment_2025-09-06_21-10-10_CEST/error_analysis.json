    "full_generated_solution": " Let me think step by step... First, I need to solve the inequality \\( x^2 - 5x - 4 \\le 10 \\). To do that, I should bring all terms to one side so that I can have a standard quadratic form. So, subtracting 10 from both sides gives:\n\n\\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\le 0 \\)\n\nNow, I need to find the roots of the corresponding equation \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \\) because these will help determine the intervals where the quadratic expression may be less than or equal to zero.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula here: \\( x = [5 ± sqrt(25 + 56)] / 2 \\), since discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4*1*(-14) = 25 + 56 = 81.\n\nSo, square root of 81 is 9, thus the solutions are (5+9)/2=7 and (5-9)/2=-2.\n\nTherefore, the critical points are at x = -2 and x = 7.\n\nSince the coefficient of x² is positive (1), the parabola opens upwards. This means that the quadratic expression \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\) will be below or equal to zero between its two real roots.\n\nHence, the solution set for the inequality is the closed interval [-2, 7].\n\nWait, let me verify my steps again.\n\nFirst, starting with \\( x^2 - 5x - 4 \\le 10 \\).\n\nSubtract 10: \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\le 0 \\). That seems correct.\n\nThen solving \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \\): Quadratic formula gave us x=(5±sqrt(25+56))/2 which is (5±9)/2 leading to 7 and -2. Correct.\n\nThe graph of y=x² -5x -14 is an upward opening parabola, crossing the x-axis at -2 and 7. Therefore, the portion of the parabola between -2 and 7 lies below or on the x-axis, i.e., ≤0. Hence, the solution is [-2,7]. Seems solid.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the inequality \\( x^2 - 5x - 4 \\le 10 \\):\n\n1. Subtract 10 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 5x - 14 \\le 0\n   \\]\n\n2.

Since the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\) is positive, the parabola opens upwards. The quadratic expression is ≤ 0 between its roots.\n\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{[-2, 7]}\\)",

    "ground_truth_full": "WLOG, let $a<b<c<d$. The smallest sum is $a+b=10$. The second-smallest sum is $a+c=18$. The second-largest sum is $b+d=21$. The largest sum is $c+d=29$. In summary, \\begin{align*}\\tag{1}\na+b&=10\\\\ \\tag{2}\na+c&=18\\\\ \\tag{3}\nb+d&=21\\\\ \\tag{4}\nc+d&=29\n\\end{align*} There are two sums left, $a+d$ and $b+c$. We will break this problem into two cases, the first case in which the first of the two sums is smaller than the second, and the second case in which the first of the two sums is larger than the second.\n\nIn the first case \\begin{align*} \\tag{5}\na+d&=19\\\\ \\tag{6}\nb+c&=20\n\\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (6) and subtracting (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+20-18\\Rightarrow b = 6$.

Plugging the value of $c$ into Equation (4), we find that $14+d=29 \\Rightarrow d=15$.

    "full_generated_solution": "10, 18, 19, 20, 21, 29\n\nWait, I think I'm wrong because... Hmm.\nAlright, so let me try to solve this step by step.\n\nFirst, we're given four distinct integers \\( a < b < c < d \\). When these are added in pairs, six different sums are obtained: 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 29.\n\nOur goal is to find what these four integers are, specifically in increasing order.\n\nI remember from algebra that if you know all the pairwise sums of numbers, you can figure out the original numbers by using some clever arithmetic tricks. Maybe something like adding up all the sums and relating it to the total sum?\n\nLet's denote the four integers as \\( a, b, c, d \\) where \\( a < b < c < d \\).\n\nWhen they add themselves in pairs, there will be six possible sums:\n\n\\( a + b \\), \\( a + c \\), \\( a + d \\),\n\n\\( b + c \\), \\( b + d \\),\n\n\\( c + d \\).\n\nThese correspond exactly to the given sums: 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, 29.\n\nBut wait, how do we match them correctly? It might not matter which pair corresponds to which sum since addition is commutative, but perhaps knowing certain properties about their relative sizes could help us assign the correct sums.\n\nAnother approach I recall involves considering the smallest and largest sums. The smallest sum should be \\( a + b \\), and the largest sum should be \\( c + d \\). Similarly, the next smallest would probably be \\( a + c \\), and the next largest would be \\( b + d \\). Let me test this idea.\n\nGiven our known sums: 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, 29.\n\nThe smallest is 10, so likely \\( a + b = 10 \\).\n\nThe largest is 29, so \\( c + d = 29 \\).\n\nNow, looking at the remaining sums: 18, 19, 20, 21.\n\nWe need to figure out which two of these are \\( a + c \\) or \\( a + d \\), and similarly for \\( b + c \\) or \\( b + d \\).\n\nHmm, maybe another way is to consider the average of all the sums. Since each number appears three times in the total sum of all pairs, the overall total sum divided by 3 gives an estimate for the middle term(s).\n\nCalculating the total sum of all six pairs:\n\n10 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 29.\n\nAdding those together:\n\n10 + 18 = 28,\n\n28 + 19 = 47,\n\n47 + 20 = 67,\n\n67 + 21 = 88,\n\n88 + 29 = 117.\n\nSo the total sum of all pairs is 117.\n\nSince each of the four numbers is used three times across the pairs, the total sum is equal to 3*(a + b + c + d). Therefore:\n\n3*(sum of a,b,c,d) = 117 => Sum of a,b,c,d = 117 / 3 = 39.\n\nThus, \\( a + b + c + d = 39 \\).\n\nEarlier, we had \\( a + b = 10 \\) and \\( c + d = 29 \\). So substituting into the equation above:\n\n\\( (a + b) + (c + d) = 10 + 29 = 39 \\), which checks out. Good.\n\nNext, let's look at other combinations. If we take the second smallest sum, which is 18. This must be either \\( a + c \\) or \\( b + c \\). Similarly, the third smallest is 19, which could be \\( a + d \\) or \\( b + c \\) again.\n\nAlternatively, let's note that the difference between consecutive sums may give clues about individual differences.\n\nFor example, the difference between 10 and 18 is 8; between 18 and 19 is 1; 19 to 20 is 1; 20 to 21 is 1; 21 to 29 is 8.\n\nThis suggests that there might be overlaps in the gaps, meaning that some of the larger jumps indicate multiple additions beyond just one variable change.\n\nPerhaps focusing on specific variables:\n\nIf \\( a + b = 10 \\), and \\( c + d = 29 \\), then the next smallest sum after ",

    "full_generated_solution": " Let me think... Okay, so I need to solve for x in the equation where two absolute values are equal. Hmm, how do you approach equations like this?\n\nFirst, maybe I can consider cases based on whether each expression inside the absolute value is positive or negative. So, let's break it down into different scenarios.\n\nCase 1: Both expressions inside the absolute values are non-negative.\nThat would mean:\n5x - 1 ≥ 0\nand\n3x + 2 ≥ 0\n\nLet me find when these inequalities hold true.\n\nFor 5x - 1 ≥ 0,\n5x ≥ 1\nx ≥ 1/5\n\nAnd for 3x + 2 ≥ 0,\n3x ≥ -2\nx ≥ -2/3\n\nSo combining both conditions, Case 1 applies when x ≥ max(1/5, -2/3). Since 1/5 is approximately 0.2 and -2/3 is about -0.666..., the maximum is 1/5. Therefore, x must be greater than or equal to 1/5.\n\nIn this case, since both expressions are non-negative, we can remove the absolute value signs without changing their sign:\n\n5x - 1 = 3x + 2\n\nNow, solving for x,\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides: 2x - 1 = 2\n\nAdd 1 to both sides: 2x = 3\n\nDivide by 2: x = 3/2\n\nWait a second, but isn't 3/2 (which is 1.5) greater than 1/5? Yes, so it satisfies our initial condition for Case 1. So one solution is x = 3/2.\n\nBut wait, before moving forward, should I check if there could be another solution within Case 1? Because sometimes when dealing with quadratics, extra solutions pop up, but here it's linear, so only one solution per case.\n\nOkay, now onto Case 2.\n\nCase 2: One expression inside the absolute value is non-negative, and the other is negative.\n\nThis gives us two subcases:\n\nSubcase 2a: 5x - 1 ≥ 0 and 3x + 2 < 0\nSubcase 2b: 5x - 1 < 0 and 3x + 2 ≥ 0\n\nStarting with Subcase 2a: 5x - 1 ≥ 0 implies x ≥ 1/5, while 3x + 2 < 0 implies x < -2/3.\n\nHowever, x cannot simultaneously satisfy x ≥ 1/5 and x < -2/3 because those intervals don't overlap. Thus, no solution exists in Subcase 2a.\n\nMoving on to Subcase 2b: 5x - 1 < 0 implies x < 1/5, and 3x + 2 ≥ 0 implies x ≥ -2/3.\n\nTherefore, x lies between -2/3 and 1/5.\n\nIn this interval, both expressions inside the absolute values have opposite signs. Hence, we'll rewrite the original equation accordingly.\n\nThe left side becomes -(5x - 1), which simplifies to -5x + 1, and the right side remains -(3x + 2), which is -3x - 2.\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n-5x + 1 = -3x - 2\n\nSolving for x,\n\nAdd 5x to both sides: 1 = 2x - 2\n\nThen add 2 to both sides: 3 = 2x\n\nThus, x = 3/2 again.\n\nHold on, earlier we had x = 3/2 as a solution in Case 1, but now in Subcase 2b, we're getting x = 3/2 again. But does this fall under the same interval?\n\nLooking back at Subcase 2b, x needs to be less than 1/5 (~0.2) and greater than or equal to -2/3 (~-0.666...).\n\nBut 3/2 is 1.5, which is way outside this range. Wait, that seems contradictory. Did I make an error somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps not necessarily conflicting; just that even though algebraically we get x=3/2, it doesn't lie within the required interval for Subcase 2b. Therefore, despite being a mathematical solution, it doesn't actually satisfy the constraints of that particular subcase.\n\nHence, Subcase 2b yields no valid solution because x=3/2 doesn't meet the necessary inequality conditions (-2/3 ≤ x < 1/5).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my mistake was assuming that after setting up the equation, the solution still falls into the correct interval. Maybe I should verify.\n\nIndeed,",
