    "ground_truth_answer": "-\\frac{1}{8}",
    "full_generated_solution": " Let me think... Okay, so I need to solve for x in the equation where two absolute values are equal. Hmm, how do you approach equations like this?\n\nFirst, maybe I can consider cases based on whether each expression inside the absolute value is positive or negative. So, let's break it down into different scenarios.\n\nCase 1: Both expressions inside the absolute values are non-negative.\nThat would mean:\n5x - 1 ≥ 0\nand\n3x + 2 ≥ 0\n\nLet me find when these inequalities hold true.\n\nFor 5x - 1 ≥ 0,\n5x ≥ 1\nx ≥ 1/5\n\nAnd for 3x + 2 ≥ 0,\n3x ≥ -2\nx ≥ -2/3\n\nSo combining both conditions, Case 1 applies when x ≥ max(1/5, -2/3). Since 1/5 is approximately 0.2 and -2/3 is about -0.666..., the maximum is 1/5. Therefore, x must be greater than or equal to 1/5.\n\nIn this case, since both expressions are non-negative, we can remove the absolute value signs without changing their sign:\n\n5x - 1 = 3x + 2\n\nNow, solving for x,\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides: 2x - 1 = 2\n\nAdd 1 to both sides: 2x = 3\n\nDivide by 2: x = 3/2\n\nWait a second, but isn't 3/2 (which is 1.5) greater than 1/5? Yes, so it satisfies our initial condition for Case 1. So one solution is x = 3/2.\n\nBut wait, before moving forward, should I check if there could be another solution within Case 1? Because sometimes when dealing with quadratics, extra solutions pop up, but here it's linear, so only one solution per case.\n\nOkay, now onto Case 2.\n\nCase 2: One expression inside the absolute value is non-negative, and the other is negative.\n\nThis gives us two subcases:\n\nSubcase 2a: 5x - 1 ≥ 0 and 3x + 2 < 0\nSubcase 2b: 5x - 1 < 0 and 3x + 2 ≥ 0\n\nStarting with Subcase 2a: 5x - 1 ≥ 0 implies x ≥ 1/5, while 3x + 2 < 0 implies x < -2/3.\n\nHowever, x cannot simultaneously satisfy x ≥ 1/5 and x < -2/3 because those intervals don't overlap. Thus, no solution exists in Subcase 2a.\n\nMoving on to Subcase 2b: 5x - 1 < 0 implies x < 1/5, and 3x + 2 ≥ 0 implies x ≥ -2/3.\n\nTherefore, x lies between -2/3 and 1/5.\n\nIn this interval, both expressions inside the absolute values have opposite signs. Hence, we'll rewrite the original equation accordingly.\n\nThe left side becomes -(5x - 1), which simplifies to -5x + 1, and the right side remains -(3x + 2), which is -3x - 2.\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n-5x + 1 = -3x - 2\n\nSolving for x,\n\nAdd 5x to both sides: 1 = 2x - 2\n\nThen add 2 to both sides: 3 = 2x\n\nThus, x = 3/2 again.\n\nHold on, earlier we had x = 3/2 as a solution in Case 1, but now in Subcase 2b, we're getting x = 3/2 again. But does this fall under the same interval?\n\nLooking back at Subcase 2b, x needs to be less than 1/5 (~0.2) and greater than or equal to -2/3 (~-0.666...).\n\nBut 3/2 is 1.5, which is way outside this range. Wait, that seems contradictory. Did I make an error somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps not necessarily conflicting; just that even though algebraically we get x=3/2, it doesn't lie within the required interval for Subcase 2b. Therefore, despite being a mathematical solution, it doesn't actually satisfy the constraints of that particular subcase.\n\nHence, Subcase 2b yields no valid solution because x=3/2 doesn't meet the necessary inequality conditions (-2/3 ≤ x < 1/5).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my mistake was assuming that after setting up the equation, the solution still falls into the correct interval. Maybe I should verify.\n\nIndeed,",

The solution is presented as numbered lines below.\n\nORIGINAL PROBLEM:\nWhat is the smallest value of $x$ such that $|5x - 1| = |3x + 2|$? Express your answer as a common fraction.\n\nNUMBERED LINES FROM SOLUTION:\nLine 1: Let me think... Okay, so I need to solve for x in the equation where two absolute values are equal. Hmm, how do you approach equations like this?\\nLine 2: First, maybe I can consider cases based on whether each expression inside the absolute value is positive or negative. So, let's break it down into different scenarios.\\nLine 3: Case 1: Both expressions inside the absolute values are non-negative.\\nLine 4: That would mean:\\nLine 5: 5x - 1 ≥ 0\\nLine 6: and\\nLine 7: 3x + 2 ≥ 0\\nLine 8: Let me find when these inequalities hold true.\\nLine 9: For 5x - 1 ≥ 0,\\nLine 10: 5x ≥ 1\\nLine 11: x ≥ 1/5\\nLine 12: And for 3x + 2 ≥ 0,\\nLine 13: 3x ≥ -2\\nLine 14: x ≥ -2/3\\nLine 15: So combining both conditions, Case 1 applies when x ≥ max(1/5, -2/3). Since 1/5 is approximately 0.2 and -2/3 is about -0.666..., the maximum is 1/5. Therefore, x must be greater than or equal to 1/5.\\nLine 16: In this case, since both expressions are non-negative, we can remove the absolute value signs without changing their sign:\\nLine 17: 5x - 1 = 3x + 2\\nLine 18: Now, solving for x,\\nLine 19: Subtract 3x from both sides: 2x - 1 = 2\\nLine 20: Add 1 to both sides: 2x = 3\\nLine 21: Divide by 2: x = 3/2\\nLine 22: Wait a second, but isn't 3/2 (which is 1.5) greater than 1/5? Yes, so it satisfies our initial condition for Case 1. So one solution is x = 3/2.\\nLine 23: But wait, before moving forward, should I check if there could be another solution within Case 1? Because sometimes when dealing with quadratics, extra solutions pop up, but here it's linear, so only one solution per case.\\nLine 24: Okay, now onto Case 2.\\nLine 25: Case 2: One expression inside the absolute value is non-negative, and the other is negative.\\nLine 26: This gives us two subcases:\\nLine 27: Subcase 2a: 5x - 1 ≥ 0 and 3x + 2 < 0\\nLine 28: Subcase 2b: 5x - 1 < 0 and 3x + 2 ≥ 0\\nLine 29: Starting with Subcase 2a: 5x - 1 ≥ 0 implies x ≥ 1/5, while 3x + 2 < 0 implies x < -2/3.\\nLine 30: However, x cannot simultaneously satisfy x ≥ 1/5 and x < -2/3 because those intervals don't overlap.
