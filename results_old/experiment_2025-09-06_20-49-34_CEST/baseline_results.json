    "raw_prompt": "Solve this math problem. Be concise and direct. ALWAYS end with \\boxed{answer}.\n\nProblem: How many vertical asymptotes does the graph of $y=\\frac{2}{x^2+x-6}$ have?\n\nSolution: ",
    "ground_truth_full": "The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.",
    "ground_truth_answer": "2",
    "full_generated_solution": "1\n\nWait, I'm not sure if my answer is correct.\nAlright, so let me try to figure out how many vertical asymptotes the function \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\) has. Hmm, okay, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator equals zero because that's where the function isn't defined—it blows up or goes to infinity. So first step, I need to factor the denominator to find its roots.\n\nThe denominator is a quadratic equation: \\( x^2 + x - 6 \\). Let me see if it factors nicely. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to 1. Hmmm... Let's think—3 and -2? Yes! Because 3 * (-2) = -6 and 3 + (-2) = 1. Perfect!\n\nSo, factoring the denominator gives us:\n\\( x^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2) \\)\n\nTherefore, the original function can be rewritten as:\n\\( y = \\frac{2}{(x + 3)(x - 2)} \\)\n\nNow, setting each factor equal to zero will give the values of x where the function has vertical asymptotes:\n1. \\( x + 3 = 0 \\) leads to \\( x = -3 \\)\n2. \\( x - 2 = 0 \\) leads to \\( x = 2 \\)\n\nEach of these x-values makes the denominator zero, which means the function approaches positive or negative infinity near those points, creating vertical asymptotes at \\( x = -3 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\).\n\nSince there are two distinct solutions here, both leading to vertical asymptotes, the number of vertical asymptotes in the graph is 2.\n\nBut wait, hold on—I just want to make sure I didn’t miss anything else. Is there any possibility that one of these might cancel out with something in the numerator? The numerator is just 2, which doesn't involve x, so nope, they don't interfere. Therefore, all zeros of the denominator contribute directly to vertical asymptotes without cancellation.\n\nHence, yeah, only two vertical asymptotes exist for this function.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2}\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many vertical asymptotes the graph of \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\) has, we need to find the values of \\( x \\) that make the denominator zero.\n\nFirst, we factor the denominator:\n\\[ x^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2) \\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:\n1. \\( x + 3 = 0 \\) leads to \\( x = -3 \\)\n2. \\( x - 2 = 0 \\) leads to \\( x = 2 \\)\n\nThese values create vertical asymptotes at \\( x = -3 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\).\n\nThus, the number of vertical asymptotes is 2.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",

    "ground_truth_full": "First, we note that $x$ must be positive, since otherwise $\\lceil x \\rceil + x$ is nonpositive. Next, we know that the decimal part of $x$ must be $\\dfrac{2}{7}$. We write $x$ as $n+\\dfrac{2}{7}$, where $n$ is the greatest integer less than $x.$ Then, $\\lceil x \\rceil = n + 1.$ Therefore, we can write $\\lceil x \\rceil + x$ as $n+1+n+\\dfrac{2}{7}=\\dfrac{23}{7}$. Solving, we get $n=1$. Therefore, the only value $x$ that satisfies the equation is $1+\\dfrac{2}{7}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{7}}$.",
    "ground_truth_answer": "\\dfrac{9}{7}",
    "full_generated_solution": "1\n\nWait, the solution is wrong because... Hmm, I need to figure out why it's incorrect.\nAlright, let me try again. So, we have an equation involving ceiling functions and fractions. The original equation is:\n\n$\\lceil x \\rceil + x = \\dfrac{23}{7}$\n\nWe're supposed to find $x$, express it as a common fraction, and always end with \\boxed{answer}. \n\nOkay, so first off, what does the ceiling function do? It takes any real number and rounds it up to the nearest integer. For example, if $x$ is 1.2, then $\\lceil x \\rceil$ would be 2. If $x$ is exactly 2, then $\\lceil x \\rceil$ is also 2.\n\nSo in our case, since we have both $x$ and its ceiling added together equals $\\dfrac{23}{7}$, which is approximately 3.2857. That tells us something about how big $x$ must be.\n\nLet’s denote $n = \\lceil x \\rceil$, where $n$ is an integer. Then, according to the definition of ceiling, we know that:\n\n$n - 1 < x \\leq n$\n\nAnd substituting back into our original equation:\n\n$n + x = \\dfrac{23}{7}$\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n$x = \\dfrac{23}{7} - n$\n\nBut from earlier, we have:\n\n$n - 1 < x \\leq n$\n\nSubstituting $x$ gives:\n\n$n - 1 < \\dfrac{23}{7} - n \\leq n$\n\nNow, let's solve these inequalities step by step.\n\nFirst inequality:\n$n - 1 < \\dfrac{23}{7} - n$\nBring like terms together:\n$n + n < \\dfrac{23}{7} + 1$\n$2n < \\dfrac{23}{7} + \\dfrac{7}{7}$\n$2n < \\dfrac{30}{7}$\nDivide both sides by 2:\n$n < \\dfrac{15}{7}$\n\nSince $n$ is an integer, the maximum possible value for $n$ here is 2 (since 15/7 ≈ 2.14).\n\nSecond inequality:\n$\\dfrac{23}{7} - n \\leq n$\nAgain, bring like terms together:\n$\\dfrac{23}{7} \\leq 2n$\nMultiply both sides by 1/2:\n$\\dfrac{23}{14} \\leq n$\n\nCalculating 23 divided by 14, which is approximately 1.6429. Since $n$ has to be an integer greater than or equal to 1.6429, the smallest possible integer $n$ is 2.\n\nPutting both results together, $n$ must satisfy:\n\n$2 \\leq n < \\dfrac{15}{7} \\approx 2.14$\n\nTherefore, $n$ must be 2.\n\nNow, substitute $n=2$ back into the expression for $x$:\n\n$x = \\dfrac{23}{7} - 2 = \\dfrac{23}{7} - \\dfrac{14}{7} = \\dfrac{9}{7}$\n\nCheck whether this satisfies the initial condition on $x$: $n-1 < x \\leq n$\n\nWith $n=2$, this becomes:\n\n$1 < \\dfrac{9}{7} \\leq 2$\n\nCalculate $\\dfrac{9}{7}$, which is approximately 1.2857. Indeed, 1 < 1.2857 ≤ 2 holds true.\n\nThus, $x = \\dfrac{9}{7}$ seems correct.\n\nWait, but initially, when I thought the answer was 1, perhaps there was confusion. Let me verify once more.\n\nIf $x=1$, then $\\lceil x \\rceil =1$, so their sum is 2, which is way less than 23/7 (~3.2857). Therefore, my previous conclusion that the solution was 1 was incorrect.\n\nHence, after carefully solving the equations, considering the constraints imposed by the ceiling function, and verifying each step, the correct value of $x$ should indeed be $\\dfrac{9}{7}$.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( x \\) is \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{7}}.\n</think>\n\nGiven the equation involving the ceiling function:\n\n\\[\n\\lceil x \\rceil + x = \\dfrac{23}{7}\n\\]\n\nwe need to find \\( x \\) expressed as a common fraction.",

When these are added in pairs, six different sums are obtained: 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 29.\n\nOur goal is to find what these four integers are, specifically in increasing order.\n\nI remember from algebra that if you know all the pairwise sums of numbers, you can figure out the original numbers by using some clever arithmetic tricks. Maybe something like adding up all the sums and relating it to the total sum?\n\nLet's denote the four integers as \\( a, b, c, d \\) where \\( a < b < c < d \\).\n\nWhen they add themselves in pairs, there will be six possible sums:\n\n\\( a + b \\), \\( a + c \\), \\( a + d \\),\n\n\\( b + c \\), \\( b + d \\),\n\n\\( c + d \\).\n\nThese correspond exactly to the given sums: 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, 29.\n\nBut wait, how do we match them correctly? It might not matter which pair corresponds to which sum since addition is commutative, but perhaps knowing certain properties about their relative sizes could help us assign the correct sums.\n\nAnother approach I recall involves considering the smallest and largest sums. The smallest sum should be \\( a + b \\), and the largest sum should be \\( c + d \\). Similarly, the next smallest would probably be \\( a + c \\), and the next largest would be \\( b + d \\). Let me test this idea.\n\nGiven our known sums: 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, 29.\n\nThe smallest is 10, so likely \\( a + b = 10 \\).\n\nThe largest is 29, so \\( c + d = 29 \\).\n\nNow, looking at the remaining sums: 18, 19, 20, 21.\n\nWe need to figure out which two of these are \\( a + c \\) or \\( a + d \\), and similarly for \\( b + c \\) or \\( b + d \\).\n\nHmm, maybe another way is to consider the average of all the sums. Since each number appears three times in the total sum of all pairs, the overall total sum divided by 3 gives an estimate for the middle term(s).\n\nCalculating the total sum of all six pairs:\n\n10 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 29.\n\nAdding those together:\n\n10 + 18 = 28,\n\n28 + 19 = 47,\n\n47 + 20 = 67,\n\n67 + 21 = 88,\n\n88 + 29 = 117.\n\nSo the total sum of all pairs is 117.\n\nSince each of the four numbers is used three times across the pairs, the total sum is equal to 3*(a + b + c + d). Therefore:\n\n3*(sum of a,b,c,d) = 117 => Sum of a,b,c,d = 117 / 3 = 39.\n\nThus, \\( a + b + c + d = 39 \\).\n\nEarlier, we had \\( a + b = 10 \\) and \\( c + d = 29 \\). So substituting into the equation above:\n\n\\( (a + b) + (c + d) = 10 + 29 = 39 \\), which checks out. Good.\n\nNext, let's look at other combinations. If we take the second smallest sum, which is 18. This must be either \\( a + c \\) or \\( b + c \\). Similarly, the third smallest is 19, which could be \\( a + d \\) or \\( b + c \\) again.\n\nAlternatively, let's note that the difference between consecutive sums may give clues about individual differences.\n\nFor example, the difference between 10 and 18 is 8; between 18 and 19 is 1; 19 to 20 is 1; 20 to 21 is 1; 21 to 29 is 8.\n\nThis suggests that there might be overlaps in the gaps, meaning that some of the larger jumps indicate multiple additions beyond just one variable change.\n\nPerhaps focusing on specific variables:\n\nIf \\( a + b = 10 \\), and \\( c + d = 29 \\), then the next smallest sum after ",

    "full_generated_solution": " Let me think... Okay, so I need to solve for x in the equation where two absolute values are equal. Hmm, how do you approach equations like this?\n\nFirst, maybe I can consider cases based on whether each expression inside the absolute value is positive or negative. So, let's break it down into different scenarios.\n\nCase 1: Both expressions inside the absolute values are non-negative.\nThat would mean:\n5x - 1 ≥ 0\nand\n3x + 2 ≥ 0\n\nLet me find when these inequalities hold true.\n\nFor 5x - 1 ≥ 0,\n5x ≥ 1\nx ≥ 1/5\n\nAnd for 3x + 2 ≥ 0,\n3x ≥ -2\nx ≥ -2/3\n\nSo combining both conditions, Case 1 applies when x ≥ max(1/5, -2/3). Since 1/5 is approximately 0.2 and -2/3 is about -0.666..., the maximum is 1/5. Therefore, x must be greater than or equal to 1/5.\n\nIn this case, since both expressions are non-negative, we can remove the absolute value signs without changing their sign:\n\n5x - 1 = 3x + 2\n\nNow, solving for x,\n\nSubtract 3x from both sides: 2x - 1 = 2\n\nAdd 1 to both sides: 2x = 3\n\nDivide by 2: x = 3/2\n\nWait a second, but isn't 3/2 (which is 1.5) greater than 1/5? Yes, so it satisfies our initial condition for Case 1. So one solution is x = 3/2.\n\nBut wait, before moving forward, should I check if there could be another solution within Case 1? Because sometimes when dealing with quadratics, extra solutions pop up, but here it's linear, so only one solution per case.\n\nOkay, now onto Case 2.\n\nCase 2: One expression inside the absolute value is non-negative, and the other is negative.\n\nThis gives us two subcases:\n\nSubcase 2a: 5x - 1 ≥ 0 and 3x + 2 < 0\nSubcase 2b: 5x - 1 < 0 and 3x + 2 ≥ 0\n\nStarting with Subcase 2a: 5x - 1 ≥ 0 implies x ≥ 1/5, while 3x + 2 < 0 implies x < -2/3.\n\nHowever, x cannot simultaneously satisfy x ≥ 1/5 and x < -2/3 because those intervals don't overlap. Thus, no solution exists in Subcase 2a.\n\nMoving on to Subcase 2b: 5x - 1 < 0 implies x < 1/5, and 3x + 2 ≥ 0 implies x ≥ -2/3.\n\nTherefore, x lies between -2/3 and 1/5.\n\nIn this interval, both expressions inside the absolute values have opposite signs. Hence, we'll rewrite the original equation accordingly.\n\nThe left side becomes -(5x - 1), which simplifies to -5x + 1, and the right side remains -(3x + 2), which is -3x - 2.\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n-5x + 1 = -3x - 2\n\nSolving for x,\n\nAdd 5x to both sides: 1 = 2x - 2\n\nThen add 2 to both sides: 3 = 2x\n\nThus, x = 3/2 again.\n\nHold on, earlier we had x = 3/2 as a solution in Case 1, but now in Subcase 2b, we're getting x = 3/2 again. But does this fall under the same interval?\n\nLooking back at Subcase 2b, x needs to be less than 1/5 (~0.2) and greater than or equal to -2/3 (~-0.666...).\n\nBut 3/2 is 1.5, which is way outside this range. Wait, that seems contradictory. Did I make an error somewhere?\n\nWait, perhaps not necessarily conflicting; just that even though algebraically we get x=3/2, it doesn't lie within the required interval for Subcase 2b. Therefore, despite being a mathematical solution, it doesn't actually satisfy the constraints of that particular subcase.\n\nHence, Subcase 2b yields no valid solution because x=3/2 doesn't meet the necessary inequality conditions (-2/3 ≤ x < 1/5).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my mistake was assuming that after setting up the equation, the solution still falls into the correct interval. Maybe I should verify.\n\nIndeed,",
