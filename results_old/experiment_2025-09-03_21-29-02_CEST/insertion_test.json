Here, we have 5 unique pairwise sums but only 4 numbers. So our numbers should be such that they produce exactly 5 sums when taken together.\n\nA natural guess would be to start with the smallest number and increment it while adjusting others to maintain the sum pattern. Let's start with 1 and see how other numbers fit into this scheme.\n\nGiven the sums are 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, 29, let’s hypothesize about where each number could fit based on logical increments. \n\nFirstly, consider 10: It must come from adding two numbers, likely around 2 because \\( 1 + 9 = 10 \\). Thus,\n\\[\na + c = 10\n\\]\n\nNext, 18 seems close to 9 plus another value.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that to solve an equation, I need to isolate the variable, which in this case is x. That means I have to get x by itself on one side of the equation. Right now, the equation has 2x and then a +3. So, the first step should be to get rid of that +3. To do that, I can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation. Let me write that down:\n\n2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3\n\nSimplifying both sides, that becomes:\n\n2x = 8\n\nOkay, so now I have 2x equals 8. The next step is to get x by itself, so I need to get rid of that 2 that's multiplied by x. To do that, I can divide both sides of the equation by 2. Let me do that:\n\n(2x)/2 = 8/2\n\nSimplifying both sides, that gives me:\n\nx = 4\n\nSo, after performing those two operations—subtracting 3 and then dividing by 2—I find that x equals 4. That makes sense because if I plug 4 back into the original equation, it should hold true.\n\nLet me check that. Plugging x = 4 into 2x + 3:\n\n2*(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11\n\nWhich matches the right side of the equation, so it looks like I did it correctly.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought the final answer was 4, but now I'm second-guessing myself. No, that's not right. I think I'm just confused about the final answer part. The important thing is that each step logically follows the previous one, and the solution is consistent when I plug it back into the original equation. So, I'm confident that x = 4 is the correct solution.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(2x + 3 = 11\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \\implies 2x = 8\n   \\]\n\n2.
