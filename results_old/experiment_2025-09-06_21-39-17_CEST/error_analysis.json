The solution is presented as numbered lines below.\n\nORIGINAL PROBLEM:\nMr. Madoff invests 1000 dollars in a fund that compounds annually at a constant interest rate.  After three years, his investment has grown to 1225 dollars.  What is the annual interest rate, as a percentage?  (Round your answer to the nearest integer.)\n\nNUMBERED LINES FROM SOLUTION:\nLine 1: First, we need to determine the annual interest rate that Mr. Madoff's investment grew at.  We know that the investment grew from $1000 to $1225 over 3 years, so the interest earned over the 3 years is $1225 - $1000 = $225.  To find the annual interest rate, we divide the interest earned by the principal amount and multiply by 100 to get a percentage.  So, the annual interest rate is ($225 / $1000) * 100 = 22.5%.  Rounding to the nearest integer, the annual interest rate is $\\boxed{23\\%}$.The answer is: 23\n\nTASK: Identify the FIRST line that contains a mathematical mistake.\n\nLook for:\n- Wrong arithmetic calculations\n- Incorrect formulas or algebraic manipulations  \n- Logical errors in reasoning steps\n- Sign errors or computational mistakes\n\nCRITICAL: Respond with ONLY the line number (like \"2\" or \"3\").\nIf no mathematical mistake exists, and the final solution is actually correct, respond with \"0\".\nDo NOT explain or add any other text.",

    "ground_truth_full": "WLOG, let $a<b<c<d$. The smallest sum is $a+b=10$. The second-smallest sum is $a+c=18$. The second-largest sum is $b+d=21$. The largest sum is $c+d=29$. In summary, \\begin{align*}\\tag{1}\na+b&=10\\\\ \\tag{2}\na+c&=18\\\\ \\tag{3}\nb+d&=21\\\\ \\tag{4}\nc+d&=29\n\\end{align*} There are two sums left, $a+d$ and $b+c$. We will break this problem into two cases, the first case in which the first of the two sums is smaller than the second, and the second case in which the first of the two sums is larger than the second.\n\nIn the first case \\begin{align*} \\tag{5}\na+d&=19\\\\ \\tag{6}\nb+c&=20\n\\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (6) and subtracting (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+20-18\\Rightarrow b = 6$. Plugging this value into Equation (1), we find that $a+6=10 \\Rightarrow a=4$. Plugging the value of $a$ into Equation (2), we find that $4+c=18 \\Rightarrow c=14$. Plugging the value of $c$ into Equation (4), we find that $14+d=29 \\Rightarrow d=15$. Thus, the four integers are $4,6,14,15$.\n\nIn the second case, \\begin{align*} \\tag{7}\nb+c&=19\\\\ \\tag{8}\na+d&=20\n\\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (7) and subtracting Equation (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+19-18 \\Rightarrow b=5.5$. This case is impossible because $b$ is defined to be an integer.\n\nThus, the only solution is $\\boxed{4,6,14,15}$.",
