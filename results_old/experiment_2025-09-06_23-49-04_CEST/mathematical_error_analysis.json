Because if p=3, then q should start from next prime above or equal?\nWait no, let me correct myself:\n\nActually, starting from p=3, q starts from the smallest prime greater than or equal to max(3, ...), but perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using stars and bars isn't directly applicable here due to integer constraints on primes.\n\nHmm, another thought—maybe list out all possible ordered pairs (including duplicates) where p <= q, compute pq, ensure p and q are primes >=3, and p + q <=19, then collect unique products.\n\nBut wait, even more precise: To avoid overcounting, consider only combinations where p <= q, ensuring uniqueness.\n\nSo step-by-step process would involve enumerating all such pairs systematically.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nFirstly, identify all primes less than or equal to some upper limit based on given condition.\n\nGiven that m = p + q < 20, meaning p + q must be less than 20.\n\nSince both p and q are primes >=3, minimal value for p is 3, same for q.\n\nThus maximum any single variable can take is 17, because 3 + 17 = 20, but m has to be strictly less than 20, so p + q <=19.\n\nTherefore, our variables p and q range between 3 and 17 inclusive, being primes.\n\nNow, to find all unordered pairs {p,q} with p<=q, p>=3, q>=next_prime(p), etc., such that p + q <=19.\n\nThen, calculate pq for each pair and note down unique products.\n\nThis way, each product corresponds uniquely to one pair, avoiding duplication through ordering.\n\nHence, total number of unique products equals required answer.\n\nAlright, now proceed methodically.\n\nList all primes below 19 first:\n\nPrimes under consideration: 3,5,7,11,13,17\n\nBecause higher primes like 19 cannot contribute unless paired with lower ones, but pairing 19 with anything else gives sum exceeding 19 except itself, which won’t happen as they’re not repeated.\n\nSo primes available: [3,5,7,11,13,17]\n\nWe'll go through each prime p starting from 3, and for each p, determine allowable q primes such that q >= p and p + q <=19.\n\nStart with p=3:\n\nFind q primes >=3, q >=3, and 3 + q <=19 => q <=16.\n\nAvailable q primes within 3 to 16: 3,5,7,11,13\n\nNote that q needs to be >=p=3, so allowed qs are those primes including 3.\n\nHowever, also remember that once p increases beyond certain point, say around sqrt(m)... Hmm, actually, regardless, just stick to systematic enumeration.\n\nProceeding:\n\nFor p=3:\n\nPossible q: 3,5,7,11,13\n\nCompute pq:\n\n3*3=9\n3*5=15\n3*7=21\n3*11=33\n3*13=39\n\nThese correspond to n=9,15,21,33,39\n\nNext, p=5:\n\nNeed q >=5, and 5 + q <=19 => q <=14\n\nPrimes q >=5 and <=14: 5,7,11,13\n\nCheck whether 5 + q <=19:\n\n5+5=10 <=19 yes\n5+7=12 <=19 yes\n5+11=16 <=19 yes\n5+13=18 <=19 yes\n\nAlso check if q > previous p, i.e., q>5, but already included.\n\nCalculate pq:\n\n5*5=25\n5*7=35\n5*11=55\n5*13=65\n\nAdd these to existing set: new ns are 25,35,55,65\n\nMoving on to p=7:\n\nq >=7, 7 + q <=19 => q <=12\n\nPrimes q >=7 and <=12: 7,11\n\nAdditionally, verify 7 + q doesn't exceed 19:\n\n7+7=14 <=19\n7+11=18 <=19\n7+13=20 >19 → stop before adding 13.\n\nSo q options:7,11\n\nCalculations:\n\n7*7=49\n7*11=77\n\nAdding to current set: 49,77\n\nNext, p=11:\n\nq >=11, 11 + q <=19 ⇒ q <=8\n\nBut primes >=11 and <=8 don't exist, since 11 >8. Hence, no solutions for p=11.\n\nSimilarly, p=13:\n\nq >=13, 13 + q <=19 ⇒ q <=6\n\nAgain, primes >=13 and <=6 do not exist. No solution.\n\nSame applies for p=17:\n\nq >=17, 17 + q <=19 ⇒ q <=2, which is impossible since primes are ≥2, but q≥17 requires q≥17, leading to 17 + something too big.\n\nHence, moving forward, p stops at 7.\n\nTotal computed ps and qs:\n\nFrom p=3: 5 numbers\nFrom p=5:4 numbers\nFrom p=7:2 numbers\n\nTotal unique n's:5+4+2=11\n\nWait, hold on—is that accurate? Or did I miss something?\n\nHold on, double-check counts:\n\nStarting with p=3:\n\nq=3→n=9\nq=5→15\nq=7→21\nq=11→33\nq=13→39\nThat's five.\n\np=5:\n\nq=5→25\nq=7→35\nq=11→55\nq=13→65\nFour added.\n\np=7:\n\nq=7→49\nq=11→77\nTwo added.\n\nTotal:5+4+2=11.\n\nIs that right? But earlier, someone might argue about overlapping or missing cases.\n\nWait, could there be other pairs where p*q is counted twice? Like, suppose different factorizations lead to same product—but since factors are primes, multiplicative functions make sure each product is unique per its combination.\n\nMoreover, since we're dealing with unordered pairs, each product comes exactly once.\n\nAnother crosscheck: List all generated n's:\n\nFrom p=3:9,15,21,33,39\n\nFrom p=5:25,35,55,65\n\nFrom p=7:49,77\n\nAre these all unique across sets?\n\nYes:\n\nLooking at individual lists:\n\nSet A:9,15,21,33,39\n\nSet B:25,35,55,65\n\nSet C:49,77\n\nNo overlaps among Set A & B, nor B&C, nor A& C.\n\nIndeed, 11 elements.\n\nBut hang on—the question says \"positive prime integers\", does that include composite numbers? No—it specifies primes.\n\nSo yeah, seems consistent.\n\nWait, but what about p=q case—for instance, squares of primes.\n\nIn our computation, e.g., p=3, q=3 leads to n=9, which is square-free.\n\nOther instances, like p=5, q=5 gives n=25, which is okay.\n\nAll considered correctly.\n\nFurthermore, checking if any duplicate products were missed.\n\nE.g., Is 15 present elsewhere? From p=3, q=5.

    "full_generated_solution": " ...\n\nAlright, so here's my attempt... Okay, let me try again. The problem says that when you change the volume of a gas at a constant temperature, the pressure changes accordingly. It specifically mentions inverse proportionality between pressure and volume. So if one goes up, the other must go down because they're inversely related.\n\nI remember from school that for such problems, we can use Boyle's Law which states P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. Yeah, that sounds right. Let me write that out:\n\nP₁ × V₁ = P₂ × V₂\n\nSo plugging in the numbers given. Initially, there are 3.67 liters at a certain pressure, but wait no—actually, hold on—the initial state has a volume of 3.67 liters and an unknown pressure? Wait, actually, looking back at the problem statement—it doesn't specify whether the initial pressure was known or not. Hmm, maybe I misread something earlier.\n\nWait, re-reading the problem: \"At constant temperature, the pressure of a sample of gas is inversely proportional to its volume.\" Then, it gives specific values: \"I have some hydrogen in a 3.67-liter container with a pressure of 4 kPa.\"\n\nOh! Right, so initially, the volume is 3.67 L and the pressure is 4 kPa. And then moving them into another container, which now becomes the final volume (V₂), while keeping the temperature constant. We need to find the new pressure (P₂).\n\nGotcha. So using Boyle's law correctly, since both volumes and pressures are changing under constant T. Therefore, applying P₁V₁ = P₂V₂ makes sense.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers step by step.\n\nGiven:\nV₁ = 3.67 L\nP₁ = 4 kPa\nV₂ = 1.835 L\nFind P₂.\n\nUsing the formula:\nP₁ / V₁ = P₂ / V₂\n\nWhich rearranges to:\nP₂ = (P₁ × V₂) / V₁\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\nP₂ = (4 kPa × 1.835 L) / 3.67 L\n\nCalculating numerator first: 4 times 1.835 equals approximately 7.34.\nThen divide by 3.67: 7.34 divided by 3.67 ≈ 2.0 kPa.\n\nHmm, seems straightforward. But just making sure about units—are everything consistent? Both volumes are in liters, pressures in kilopascals; yes, unit consistency holds as long as we don’t mix different units like converting pascal to kilopascal incorrectly without considering the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, thinking through ratios: Since Volume decreases from 3.67 to 1.835, which is exactly half (because 3.67 ÷ 2 = 1.835). According to inverse proportionality, Pressure should double. Starting at 4 kPa, doubling would give us 8 kPa. Wait, conflict arises here—isn't that conflicting with previous calculation where got ~2.0 kPa?\n\nHold on—that suggests either mistake somewhere. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps miscalculations occurred during multiplication/division steps. Let’s recalculate more carefully.\n\nCompute numerator: 4 * 1.835.\n\nFirstly, compute 4*1=4, 4*.835=3.34. Adding together: 4 + 3.34 = 7.34. Correct.\n\nDenominator: 3.67.\n\nDivide 7.34 by 3.67.\n\nWell, 3.67 x 2 = 7.34. Exactly!\n\nTherefore, 7.34/3.67 = 2. Hence, P₂ = 2 kPa.\n\nBut why did the alternative method suggest 8 kPa? Because someone might think directly halving the volume doubles the pressure—but only applies when starting from equal moles and temperatures, i.e., ideal gases following PV=nRT. However, in reality, unless n remains constant—which isn't stated here—we cannot assume that.\n\nIn our case, the number of moles could potentially increase due to movement—if any additional gas comes along, but the problem didn't mention adding anything else. Similarly, removing gas wouldn't affect the count necessarily.\n\nHence, assuming that the amount of gas stays the same throughout, the two methods differ based on assumptions.\n\nThus, according to proper application of Boyle's Law, since mass and moles aren't mentioned, we can safely apply the relationship regardless of those factors—as per the question's constraints.\n\nTherefore, recalculating shows that indeed, after moving to half the original volume, the pressure halves too—from 4kPa to 2kPa.\n\nEarlier confusion arose because mistakenly applied the idea of simply dividing by 2 instead of recognizing that the product needs to remain constant across both scenarios.\n\nAnother way to see it is via cross-multiplication:\n\nIf originally, P₁×V₁ = P₂×V₂,\n\nthen substituting,\n(4)(3.67)=P₂*(1.835)\n\nCalculate left side: 4*3.67≈14.68\n\nRight side: 1.835*P₂=14.68 => solve for P₂: 14.68 /1.835≈8. But wait, that contradicts prior conclusion.\n\nWait, hold on—I'm getting confused here. What happened?\n\nNo, wait, sorry, substitution may lead to wrong result if variables mixed improperly.\n\nActually, equation is P₁V₁=P₂V₂.\n\nWe know P₁=4, V₁=3.67, V₂=1.835.\n\nPlug these in: 4*3.67= P₂*1.835.\n\nLeft side: 4*3.67=14.68.\n\nEquation: 14.68 = P₂*1.835 → solving for P₂: 14.68 /1.835≈8.\n\nWait, that conflicts with the earlier answer of 2. That means inconsistency detected.\n\nWhat went wrong here?\n\nAh, crucial point: When dealing with proportions, sometimes people get tripped over variable placement.\n\nThe key is understanding that P and V are inversely proportional, meaning their product is constant.\n\nSo, writing equations properly:\n\nInitially: P₁V₁ = Constant.\n\nAfterwards: P₂V₂ = Same Constant.\n\nTherefore, setting them equal: P₁V₁ = P₂V₂ ⇒ P₂=(P₁V₁)/V₂.\n\nSubstituted correctly: (4)*(3.67)/(1.835)=(14.68)/1.835≈8.\n\nBut previously, when computing P₂ =(P₁V₂)/V₁, that gave 2.\n\nThis discrepancy indicates a misunderstanding of how to set up the proportion.\n\nIndeed, the correct setup is P₁/V₁ = P₂/V₂, leading to P₂=(P₁V₂)/V₁.\n\nBecause in inverse variation, each pair multiplies to the same value.\n\nSo, better yet, express it as:\n\nSince P ∝ 1/V,\n\nso P₁/P₂ = V₂/V₁.\n\nCross-multiplied: P₁V₁ = P₂V₂.\n\nSame thing.\n\nSo, going back, calculating P₂=(P₁V₂)/V₁= (4*1.835)/3.67= approximates to 7.34/3.67=2.\n\nYes, that aligns with the first computation.\n\nWhereas attempting to equate P₁/(V₁)=P₂/(V₂) leads to incorrect results because it flips the relation.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that in inverse variation, multiplying P and V keeps the product constant, hence division requires maintaining the equality.\n\nTo prevent mistakes, always ensure that your algebraic manipulation maintains equivalence.\n\nMoreover, verifying calculations helps catch errors early.\n\nFor instance, checking 4*1.835 vs 2*3.67.\n\n4*1.835=7.34.\n\n2*3.67=7.34.\n\nThey match, confirming correctness.\n\nSimilarly, 8*1.835=14.68, whereas 4*3.67=14.68.\n\nConsistent.\n\nThus, concluding that the new pressure is 2 kPa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2}\n</think>\n\nGiven that the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume at constant temperature, we use Boyle's Law \\( P_1 \\times V_1 = P_2 \\times V_2 \\).\n\nInitial conditions:\n- Initial volume \\( V_1 = 3.67 \\) liters\n- Initial pressure \\( P_1 = 4 \\) kPa\n\nNew conditions:\n- New volume \\( V_2 = 1.835 \\) liters\n- Final pressure \\( P_2 \\) is to be determined\n\nApplying Boyle's Law:\n\\[ P_1 \\times V_1 = P_2 \\times V_2 \\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\( P_2 \\):\n\\[ P_2 = \\frac{P_1 \\times V_1}{V_2} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ P_2 = \\frac{4 \\, \\text{kPa} \\times 3.67 \\, \\text{L}}{1.835 \\, \\text{L",

Hmm, let's see...\n\nWait, maybe it would be better if I just write down all steps clearly so that my thought process is correct.\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The equation given is:\n\n\\[(2x + 5)(x - 3) = 14\\]\n\nI remember from algebra that when you have an expression like this on one side equal to a number, expanding them can help simplify things into a standard quadratic form, which we know how to solve using factoring or the quadratic formula.\n\nSo, first off, I should probably multiply out those two binomials on the left-hand side. Let me do that carefully because even small mistakes here could throw off everything else.\n\nMultiplying \\(2x\\) by each term in the second parenthesis:\n\\(2x * x = 2x^2\\)\n\\(2x * (-3) = -6x\\)\n\nThen multiplying 5 by each term in the same parentheses:\n\\(5 * x = 5x\\)\n\\(5 * (-3) = -15\\)\n\nNow, combining these results together:\n\\[2x^2 - 6x + 5x - 15\\]\n\nLet me combine the like terms (\\(-6x\\) and \\(5x\\)):\n\\-6x + 5x equals \\(-x\\), right?\n\nSo now, simplifying further:\n\\[2x^2 - x - 15\\]\n\nTherefore, our original equation becomes:\n\\[2x^2 - x - 15 = 14\\]\n\nHmm, okay, next step is to get all terms on one side so that we have zero on the other side. That way, we'll set up for solving either via factoring or perhaps completing the square or whatever method comes handy.\n\nSubtracting 14 from both sides:\n\\[2x^2 - x - 15 - 14 = 0\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[2x^2 - x - 29 = 0\\]\n\nHold on, wait—let me double-check that subtraction. So starting again:\n\nOriginal after expansion was \\(2x^2 - x - 15 = 14\\). Subtract 14 from both sides:\n\nLeft side: \\(2x^2 - x - 15 - 14\\).\n\nYes, subtracted correctly as \\( -15 -14 = -29\\). So yes, resulting in:\n\\[2x^2 - x - 29 = 0\\]\n\nOkay, so now we've got a quadratic equation. Now, quadratics are usually solved through factoring, but sometimes they don't factor nicely, especially since coefficients might not lead easily there. Alternatively, methods such as completing the square or applying the quadratic formula come into play.\n\nBut before jumping straight into any formulas, let me check whether this quadratic factors neatly. For that, I'd look for two numbers whose product is \\(a*c\\) where \\(a=2\\) and \\(c=-29\\), so their product is \\(2*(-29) = -58\\). And also, these two numbers must add up to \\(b\\), which is \\(-1\\).\n\nLooking at pairs of integers that multiply to -58:\n\nPossible pairs:\n1 and -58\n2 and -29\n\nCheck what adds up to -1? Well,\n\nFor pair 1 and -58: Their difference is |-58| - |1| = 57; Not close to 1.\n\nPair 2 and -29: Difference between 29 and 2 is 27; Still too big.\n\nAlternatively, negative counterparts:\n\nWhat about 29 and -2? They multiply to -58, and adding them gives 27, still no good.\n\nSimilarly, trying smaller numbers doesn’t seem helpful here. It seems like this quadratic does not factor over the integers, meaning we will likely use the quadratic formula instead.\n\nQuadratic Formula states that for ax² + bx + c = 0,\nthe solutions are:\n\\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\n\nIn our case, a = 2, b = -1, c = -29.\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n\nFirst compute discriminant D:\nD = b² - 4ac = (-1)^2 - 4*2*(-29) = 1 - 4*(2)*(-29)\n\nCompute 4*a*c part:\n4*2 = 8, then multiplied by -29: 8*(-29) = -232\n\nThus, D = 1 - (-232) = 1 + 232 = 233\n\nSince discriminant D is positive, we expect two real roots.\n\nCalculating sqrt(D): sqrt(233); approximately 15.264, but exact value remains irrational.\n\nHence, plugging back into quadratic formula:\n\nx = [ -(-1) ± sqrt(233) ] / (2*2 ) => x = [1 ± sqrt(233)]/4\n\nSo, the two solutions are:\n\nx₁ = [1 + sqrt(233)]/4 ≈ ?\n\nAnd x₂ = [1 - sqrt(233)]/4 ≈ ?\n\nHowever, the question asks for the sum of the possible values of x. Instead of calculating each root individually, isn't there a shortcut?\n\nOh! Vieta’s theorem tells us that for a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the sum of its roots is -b/a.\n\nThat makes sense because in general, if r1 and r2 are the roots, then:\n\nr1 + r2 = -(b)/a\n\nGiven that, in our equation, a = 2, b = -1.\n\nSum of roots S = -(-1)/2 = 1/2.\n\nWow, so without having to calculate individual roots, we already found the answer!\n\nBut hold on—is that applicable here?

    "anthropic_raw_input": "You are analyzing a mathematical solution with multiple reasoning steps. The solution is presented as numbered lines below.\n\nORIGINAL PROBLEM:\nIf $(2x+5)(x-3)=14$, find the sum of the possible values of $x$.\n\nNUMBERED LINES FROM SOLUTION:\nLine 1: I need to expand (2x + 5)(x - 3) first, which gives me... Hmm, let's see...\\nLine 2: Wait, maybe it would be better if I just write down all steps clearly so that my thought process is correct.\\nLine 3: Alright, let's tackle this step by step. The equation given is:\\nLine 4: \\[(2x + 5)(x - 3) = 14\\]\\nLine 5: I remember from algebra that when you have an expression like this on one side equal to a number, expanding them can help simplify things into a standard quadratic form, which we know how to solve using factoring or the quadratic formula.\\nLine 6: So, first off, I should probably multiply out those two binomials on the left-hand side. Let me do that carefully because even small mistakes here could throw off everything else.\\nLine 7: Multiplying \\(2x\\) by each term in the second parenthesis:\\nLine 8: \\(2x * x = 2x^2\\)\\nLine 9: \\(2x * (-3) = -6x\\)\\nLine 10: Then multiplying 5 by each term in the same parentheses:\\nLine 11: \\(5 * x = 5x\\)\\nLine 12: \\(5 * (-3) = -15\\)\\nLine 13: Now, combining these results together:\\nLine 14: \\[2x^2 - 6x + 5x - 15\\]\\nLine 15: Let me combine the like terms (\\(-6x\\) and \\(5x\\)):\\nLine 16: \\-6x + 5x equals \\(-x\\), right?\\nLine 17: So now, simplifying further:\\nLine 18: \\[2x^2 - x - 15\\]\\nLine 19: Therefore, our original equation becomes:\\nLine 20: \\[2x^2 - x - 15 = 14\\]\\nLine 21: Hmm, okay, next step is to get all terms on one side so that we have zero on the other side. That way, we'll set up for solving either via factoring or perhaps completing the square or whatever method comes handy.\\nLine 22: Subtracting 14 from both sides:\\nLine 23: \\[2x^2 - x - 15 - 14 = 0\\]\\nLine 24: Which simplifies to:\\nLine 25: \\[2x^2 - x - 29 = 0\\]\\nLine 26: Hold on, wait—let me double-check that subtraction. So starting again:\\nLine 27: Original after expansion was \\(2x^2 - x - 15 = 14\\). Subtract 14 from both sides:\\nLine 28: Left side: \\(2x^2 - x - 15 - 14\\).\\nLine 29: Yes, subtracted correctly as \\( -15 -14 = -29\\). So yes, resulting in:\\nLine 30: \\[2x^2 - x - 29 = 0\\]\\nLine 31: Okay, so now we've got a quadratic equation. Now, quadratics are usually solved through factoring, but sometimes they don't factor nicely, especially since coefficients might not lead easily there. Alternatively, methods such as completing the square or applying the quadratic formula come into play.\\nLine 32: But before jumping straight into any formulas, let me check whether this quadratic factors neatly. For that, I'd look for two numbers whose product is \\(a*c\\) where \\(a=2\\) and \\(c=-29\\), so their product is \\(2*(-29) = -58\\). And also, these two numbers must add up to \\(b\\), which is \\(-1\\).\\nLine 33: Looking at pairs of integers that multiply to -58:\\nLine 34: Possible pairs:\\nLine 35: 1 and -58\\nLine 36: 2 and -29\\nLine 37: Check what adds up to -1? Well,\\nLine 38: For pair 1 and -58: Their difference is |-58| - |1| = 57; Not close to 1.\\nLine 39: Pair 2 and -29: Difference between 29 and 2 is 27; Still too big.\\nLine 40: Alternatively, negative counterparts:\\nLine 41: What about 29 and -2? They multiply to -58, and adding them gives 27, still no good.\\nLine 42: Similarly, trying smaller numbers doesn’t seem helpful here. It seems like this quadratic does not factor over the integers, meaning we will likely use the quadratic formula instead.\\nLine 43: Quadratic Formula states that for ax² + bx + c = 0,\\nLine 44: the solutions are:\\nLine 45: \\[x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\]\\nLine 46: In our case, a = 2, b = -1, c = -29.\\nLine 47: Plugging these into the formula:\\nLine 48: First compute discriminant D:\\nLine 49: D = b² - 4ac = (-1)^2 - 4*2*(-29) = 1 - 4*(2)*(-29)\\nLine 50: Compute 4*a*c part:\\nLine 51: 4*2 = 8, then multiplied by -29: 8*(-29) = -232\\nLine 52: Thus, D = 1 - (-232) = 1 + 232 = 233\\nLine 53: Since discriminant D is positive, we expect two real roots.\\nLine 54: Calculating sqrt(D): sqrt(233); approximately 15.264, but exact value remains irrational.\\nLine 55: Hence, plugging back into quadratic formula:\\nLine 56: x = [ -(-1) ± sqrt(233) ] / (2*2 ) => x = [1 ± sqrt(233)]/4\\nLine 57: So, the two solutions are:\\nLine 58: x₁ = [1 + sqrt(233)]/4 ≈ ?\\nLine 59: And x₂ = [1 - sqrt(233)]/4 ≈ ?\\nLine 60: However, the question asks for the sum of the possible values of x. Instead of calculating each root individually, isn't there a shortcut?\\nLine 61: Oh! Vieta’s theorem tells us that for a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the sum of its roots is -b/a.\\nLine 62: That makes sense because in general, if r1 and r2 are the roots, then:\\nLine 63: r1 + r2 = -(b)/a\\nLine 64: Given that, in our equation, a = 2, b = -1.\\nLine 65: Sum of roots S = -(-1)/2 = 1/2.\\nLine 66: Wow, so without having to calculate individual roots, we already found the answer!\\nLine 67: But hold on—is that applicable here? Because initially, we had transformed the equation into a quadratic, ensuring that the properties apply regardless of constants involved.\\nLine 68: Indeed, Vieta's applies universally once the equation is written in standard quadratic form.\\nLine 69: So, therefore, the sum of the possible values of x is 1/2.\\nLine 70: Just to make sure, going back through the initial steps:\\nLine 71: We started with (2x +5)(x -3) =14, expanded it to 2x² -x -15=14, moved 14 to left making 2x² -x -29=0.\\nLine 72: Applied quadratic formula leading to two roots, added them giving 1/2.\\nLine 73: Alternative approach: Using Vieta directly gave the result immediately.\\nLine 74: Either way, consistent conclusion.\\nLine 75: Another sanity check—if someone were to plug in x = something, say average of roots, which is ½, test if that satisfies the equation.\\nLine 76: Suppose x = ½:\\nLine 77: Plug into LHS: (2*(½)+5)*(½ -3) = (1 +5)*(-2.5) = 6*(-2.5) = -15 ≠ RHS 14.
