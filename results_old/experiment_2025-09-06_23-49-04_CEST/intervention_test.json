So subtracting 14 from both sides:\n\n\\[2x^2 - x - 15 - 14 = 0\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[2x^2 - x - 29 = 0\\]\n\nWait, hold on—let me double-check that subtraction. Is it minus 14? Yes, right. Because moving 14 over makes it negative.\n\nBut wait another thing—is there any chance I made a mistake earlier?\n\nLooking back at the expansion:\n\n(2x + 5)(x - 3):\n\nFirst, 2x times x is indeed 2x²\n\n2x times -3 is -6x\n\n5 times x is 5x\n\n5 times -3 is -15\n\nAdding up: 2x² -6x +5x -15 => 2x² -x -15. That seems correct.\n\nSubtracting 14: yes, leading to 2x² -x -29=0.\n\nIs that factorable? Or will I need to use the quadratic formula?\n\nQuadratic equations are usually solved either by factoring where possible, otherwise via the quadratic formula.\n\nTrying to factor 2x² -x -29 might not be straightforward since the product of 2*(-29)= -58 doesn't seem easily broken into factors that add up appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying rational roots but considering discriminant D=b²−4ac.\n\nFor ax²+bx+c=0,\n\nHere, a=2, b=-1, c=-29.\n\nDiscriminant D=(-1)^2 −4*2*(-29)=1 + 232=233.\n\nSince sqrt(233) isn’t a whole number—it’s approximately 15.27—I think it won’t result in integer solutions.\n\nTherefore, likely no nice factors; hence, must apply quadratic formula.\n\nThe quadratic formula states that for ax² + bx +c=0,\nthe solutions are:\n\nx=(−b ±√D)/(2a).\n\nPlugging values:\n\nx=(1±sqrt(233))/4.\n\nThus, exact answers involve square root expressions.\n\nHowever, sometimes problems may prefer decimal approximations unless specified otherwise.\n\nBut as per instructions, always ending with boxed answer. Since they didn't specify whether approximate or exact, but often in such cases, especially without context, exact forms preferred.\n\nHence, writing the final solution as:\n\nx equals [1 plus or minus sqrt(233)] divided by 4.\n\nExpressed neatly inside boxes:\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{233}}{4}}\\]\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{233}}{4}}\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\((2x + 5)(x - 3) = 14\\), we start by expanding the left-hand side.\n\nExpanding \\((2x + 5)(x - 3)\\):\n\\[\n(2x + 5)(x - 3) = 2x \\cdot x + 2x \\cdot (-3) + 5 \\cdot x + 5 \\cdot (-3)\n\\]\n\\[\n= 2x^2 - 6x + 5x - 15\n\\]\nCombining like terms:\n\\[\n2x^2 - x - 15\n\\]\n\nNext, we move all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:\n\\[\n2x^2 - x - 15 = 14\n\\]\nSubtracting 14 from both sides:\n\\[\n2x^2 - x - 29 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis quadratic equation does not factor nicely, so we use the quadratic formula \\(x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\). Here, \\(a = 2\\), \\(b = -1\\), and \\(c = -29\\).\n\nCalculating the discriminant:\n\\[\nb^2 - 4ac = (-1)^2 - 4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (-29) = 1 + 232 = 233\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{233}}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{233}}{4}\n\\]\n\nThus, the solutions are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{233}}{4}}\n\\]",

Hmm, let's see...\n\nWait, maybe it would be better if I just write down all steps clearly so that my thought process is correct.\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. The equation given is:\n\n\\[(2x + 5)(x - 3) = 14\\]\n\nI remember from algebra that when you have an expression like this on one side equal to a number, expanding them can help simplify things into a standard quadratic form, which we know how to solve using factoring or the quadratic formula.\n\nSo, first off, I should probably multiply out those two binomials on the left-hand side. Let me do that carefully because even small mistakes here could throw off everything else.\n\nMultiplying \\(2x\\) by each term in the second parenthesis:\n\\(2x * x = 2x^2\\)\n\\(2x * (-3) = -6x\\)\n\nThen multiplying 5 by each term in the same parentheses:\n\\(5 * x = 5x\\)\n\\(5 * (-3) = -15\\)\n\nNow, combining these results together:\n\\[2x^2 - 6x + 5x - 15\\]\n\nLet me combine the like terms (\\(-6x\\) and \\(5x\\)):\n Wait.
