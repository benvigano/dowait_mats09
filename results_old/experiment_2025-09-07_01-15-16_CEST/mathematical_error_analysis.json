    "full_generated_solution": "1) Let’s denote the two primes as p and q, so m = p + q and n = pq.\n2) Since both p and q are at least 3, their sum is at least 6; since m < 20, we have p + q ≤ 19.\n3) So all pairs where p and q satisfy these conditions will give us valid m and hence a corresponding n.\n4) We need to count the number of such unique products pq without considering order because multiplication is commutative.\n5) Therefore, it's equivalent to counting unordered pairs {p, q}, which can be done by generating them in ascending order for each p from 3 upwards until p exceeds half of 19.\n6) For example:\n   - When p=3, q ranges from 7 up to 13 (since 3+13=16≤19)\n- Wait, I think you made an error here when listing q after 7? Because if p=3, then q should start from next prime above or equal?\nWait no, let me correct myself:\n\nActually, starting from p=3, q starts from the smallest prime greater than or equal to max(3, ...), but perhaps my initial approach was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using stars and bars isn't directly applicable here due to integer constraints on primes.\n\nHmm, another thought—maybe list out all possible ordered pairs (including duplicates) where p <= q, compute pq, ensure p and q are primes >=3, and p + q <=19, then collect unique products.\n\nBut wait, even more precise: To avoid overcounting, consider only combinations where p <= q, ensuring uniqueness.\n\nSo step-by-step process would involve enumerating all such pairs systematically.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nFirstly, identify all primes less than or equal to some upper limit based on given condition.\n\nGiven that m = p + q < 20, meaning p + q must be less than 20.\n\nSince both p and q are primes >=3, minimal value for p is 3, same for q.\n\nThus maximum any single variable can take is 17, because 3 + 17 = 20, but m has to be strictly less than 20, so p + q <=19.\n\nTherefore, our variables p and q range between 3 and 17 inclusive, being primes.\n\nNow, to find all unordered pairs {p,q} with p<=q, p>=3, q>=next_prime(p), etc., such that p + q <=19.\n\nThen, calculate pq for each pair and note down unique products.\n\nThis way, each product corresponds uniquely to one pair, avoiding duplication through ordering.\n\nHence, total number of unique products equals required answer.\n\nAlright, now proceed methodically.\n\nList all primes below 19 first:\n\nPrimes under consideration: 3,5,7,11,13,17\n\nBecause higher primes like 19 cannot contribute unless paired with lower ones, but pairing 19 with anything else gives sum exceeding 19 except itself, which won’t happen as they’re not repeated.\n\nSo primes available: [3,5,7,11,13,17]\n\nWe'll go through each prime p starting from 3, and for each p, determine allowable q primes such that q >= p and p + q <=19.\n\nStart with p=3:\n\nFind q primes >=3, q >=3, and 3 + q <=19 => q <=16.\n\nAvailable q primes within 3 to 16: 3,5,7,11,13\n\nNote that q needs to be >=p=3, so allowed qs are those primes including 3.\n\nHowever, also remember that once p increases beyond certain point, say around sqrt(m)... Hmm, actually, regardless, just stick to systematic enumeration.\n\nProceeding:\n\nFor p=3:\n\nPossible q: 3,5,7,11,13\n\nCompute pq:\n\n3*3=9\n3*5=15\n3*7=21\n3*11=33\n3*13=39\n\nThese correspond to n=9,15,21,33,39\n\nNext, p=5:\n\nNeed q >=5, and 5 + q <=19 => q <=14\n\nPrimes q >=5 and <=14: 5,7,11,13\n\nCheck whether 5 + q <=19:\n\n5+5=10 <=19 yes\n5+7=12 <=19 yes\n5+11=16 <=19 yes\n5+13=18 <=19 yes\n\nAlso check if q > previous p, i.e., q>5, but already included.\n\nCalculate pq:\n\n5*5=25\n5*7=35\n5*11=55\n5*13=65\n\nAdd these to existing set: new ns are 25,35,55,65\n\nMoving on to p=7:\n\nq >=7, 7 + q <=19 => q <=12\n\nPrimes q >=7 and <=12: 7,11\n\nAdditionally, verify 7 + q doesn't exceed 19:\n\n7+7=14 <=19\n7+11=18 <=19\n7+13=20 >19 → stop before adding 13.\n\nSo q options:7,11\n\nCalculations:\n\n7*7=49\n7*11=77\n\nAdding to current set: 49,77\n\nNext, p=11:\n\nq >=11, 11 + q <=19 ⇒ q <=8\n\nBut primes >=11 and <=8 don't exist, since 11 >8. Hence, no solutions for p=11.\n\nSimilarly, p=13:\n\nq >=13, 13 + q <=19 ⇒ q <=6\n\nAgain, primes >=13 and <=6 do not exist. No solution.\n\nSame applies for p=17:\n\nq >=17, 17 + q <=19 ⇒ q <=2, which is impossible since primes are ≥2, but q≥17 requires q≥17, leading to 17 + something too big.\n\nHence, moving forward, p stops at 7.\n\nTotal computed ps and qs:\n\nFrom p=3: 5 numbers\nFrom p=5:4 numbers\nFrom p=7:2 numbers\n\nTotal unique n's:5+4+2=11\n\nWait, hold on—is that accurate? Or did I miss something?\n\nHold on, double-check counts:\n\nStarting with p=3:\n\nq=3→n=9\nq=5→15\nq=7→21\nq=11→33\nq=13→39\nThat's five.\n\np=5:\n\nq=5→25\nq=7→35\nq=11→55\nq=13→65\nFour added.\n\np=7:\n\nq=7→49\nq=11→77\nTwo added.\n\nTotal:5+4+2=11.\n\nIs that right? But earlier, someone might argue about overlapping or missing cases.\n\nWait, could there be other pairs where p*q is counted twice? Like, suppose different factorizations lead to same product—but since factors are primes, multiplicative functions make sure each product is unique per its combination.\n\nMoreover, since we're dealing with unordered pairs, each product comes exactly once.\n\nAnother crosscheck: List all generated n's:\n\nFrom p=3:9,15,21,33,39\n\nFrom p=5:25,35,55,65\n\nFrom p=7:49,77\n\nAre these all unique across sets?\n\nYes:\n\nLooking at individual lists:\n\nSet A:9,15,21,33,39\n\nSet B:25,35,55,65\n\nSet C:49,77\n\nNo overlaps among Set A & B, nor B&C, nor A& C.\n\nIndeed, 11 elements.\n\nBut hang on—the question says \"positive prime integers\", does that include composite numbers? No—it specifies primes.\n\nSo yeah, seems consistent.\n\nWait, but what about p=q case—for instance, squares of primes.\n\nIn our computation, e.g., p=3, q=3 leads to n=9, which is square-free.\n\nOther instances, like p=5, q=5 gives n=25, which is okay.\n\nAll considered correctly.\n\nFurthermore, checking if any duplicate products were missed.\n\nE.g., Is 15 present elsewhere? From p=3, q=5. Only once.\n\n21 appears once.\n\n33,39 similarly.\n\nOthers seem unique.\n\nThus, conclusion: There are 11 possible values of n.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of possible values of \\( n \\) is \\(\\boxed{11}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the number of possible values of \\( n \\) for the quadratic polynomial \\( x^2 - mx + n \\) where the roots are positive prime integers. The key steps are as follows:\n\n1. **Identify Primes**: Identify all primes less than or equal to 19, as the sum of two primes must be less than 20. These primes are: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17",

The value of the stamp is assumed to double every three years.

    "ground_truth_answer": "8",
    "full_generated_solution": " ...\n\nAlright, so here's my attempt... Okay, let me try again. The problem says that when you change the volume of a gas at a constant temperature, the pressure changes accordingly. It specifically mentions inverse proportionality between pressure and volume. So if one goes up, the other must go down because they're inversely related.\n\nI remember from school that for such problems, we can use Boyle's Law which states P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. Yeah, that sounds right. Let me write that out:\n\nP₁ × V₁ = P₂ × V₂\n\nSo plugging in the numbers given. Initially, there are 3.67 liters at a certain pressure, but wait no—actually, hold on—the initial state has a volume of 3.67 liters and an unknown pressure? Wait, actually, looking back at the problem statement—it doesn't specify whether the initial pressure was known or not. Hmm, maybe I misread something earlier.\n\nWait, re-reading the problem: \"At constant temperature, the pressure of a sample of gas is inversely proportional to its volume.\" Then, it gives specific values: \"I have some hydrogen in a 3.67-liter container with a pressure of 4 kPa.\"\n\nOh! Right, so initially, the volume is 3.67 L and the pressure is 4 kPa. And then moving them into another container, which now becomes the final volume (V₂), while keeping the temperature constant. We need to find the new pressure (P₂).\n\nGotcha. So using Boyle's law correctly, since both volumes and pressures are changing under constant T. Therefore, applying P₁V₁ = P₂V₂ makes sense.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers step by step.\n\nGiven:\nV₁ = 3.67 L\nP₁ = 4 kPa\nV₂ = 1.835 L\nFind P₂.\n\nUsing the formula:\nP₁ / V₁ = P₂ / V₂\n\nWhich rearranges to:\nP₂ = (P₁ × V₂) / V₁\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\nP₂ = (4 kPa × 1.835 L) / 3.67 L\n\nCalculating numerator first: 4 times 1.835 equals approximately 7.34.\nThen divide by 3.67: 7.34 divided by 3.67 ≈ 2.0 kPa.\n\nHmm, seems straightforward. But just making sure about units—are everything consistent? Both volumes are in liters, pressures in kilopascals; yes, unit consistency holds as long as we don’t mix different units like converting pascal to kilopascal incorrectly without considering the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, thinking through ratios: Since Volume decreases from 3.67 to 1.835, which is exactly half (because 3.67 ÷ 2 = 1.835). According to inverse proportionality, Pressure should double. Starting at 4 kPa, doubling would give us 8 kPa. Wait, conflict arises here—isn't that conflicting with previous calculation where got ~2.0 kPa?\n\nHold on—that suggests either mistake somewhere. Which approach is correct?\n\nWait, perhaps miscalculations occurred during multiplication/division steps. Let’s recalculate more carefully.\n\nCompute numerator: 4 * 1.835.\n\nFirstly, compute 4*1=4, 4*.835=3.34. Adding together: 4 + 3.34 = 7.34. Correct.\n\nDenominator: 3.67.\n\nDivide 7.34 by 3.67.\n\nWell, 3.67 x 2 = 7.34. Exactly!\n\nTherefore, 7.34/3.67 = 2. Hence, P₂ = 2 kPa.\n\nBut why did the alternative method suggest 8 kPa? Because someone might think directly halving the volume doubles the pressure—but only applies when starting from equal moles and temperatures, i.e., ideal gases following PV=nRT. However, in reality, unless n remains constant—which isn't stated here—we cannot assume that.\n\nIn our case, the number of moles could potentially increase due to movement—if any additional gas comes along, but the problem didn't mention adding anything else. Similarly, removing gas wouldn't affect the count necessarily.\n\nHence, assuming that the amount of gas stays the same throughout, the two methods differ based on assumptions.\n\nThus, according to proper application of Boyle's Law, since mass and moles aren't mentioned, we can safely apply the relationship regardless of those factors—as per the question's constraints.\n\nTherefore, recalculating shows that indeed, after moving to half the original volume, the pressure halves too—from 4kPa to 2kPa.\n\nEarlier confusion arose because mistakenly applied the idea of simply dividing by 2 instead of recognizing that the product needs to remain constant across both scenarios.\n\nAnother way to see it is via cross-multiplication:\n\nIf originally, P₁×V₁ = P₂×V₂,\n\nthen substituting,\n(4)(3.67)=P₂*(1.835)\n\nCalculate left side: 4*3.67≈14.68\n\nRight side: 1.835*P₂=14.68 => solve for P₂: 14.68 /1.835≈8. But wait, that contradicts prior conclusion.\n\nWait, hold on—I'm getting confused here. What happened?\n\nNo, wait, sorry, substitution may lead to wrong result if variables mixed improperly.\n\nActually, equation is P₁V₁=P₂V₂.\n\nWe know P₁=4, V₁=3.67, V₂=1.835.\n\nPlug these in: 4*3.67= P₂*1.835.\n\nLeft side: 4*3.67=14.68.\n\nEquation: 14.68 = P₂*1.835 → solving for P₂: 14.68 /1.835≈8.\n\nWait, that conflicts with the earlier answer of 2. That means inconsistency detected.\n\nWhat went wrong here?\n\nAh, crucial point: When dealing with proportions, sometimes people get tripped over variable placement.\n\nThe key is understanding that P and V are inversely proportional, meaning their product is constant.\n\nSo, writing equations properly:\n\nInitially: P₁V₁ = Constant.\n\nAfterwards: P₂V₂ = Same Constant.\n\nTherefore, setting them equal: P₁V₁ = P₂V₂ ⇒ P₂=(P₁V₁)/V₂.\n\nSubstituted correctly: (4)*(3.67)/(1.835)=(14.68)/1.835≈8.\n\nBut previously, when computing P₂ =(P₁V₂)/V₁, that gave 2.\n\nThis discrepancy indicates a misunderstanding of how to set up the proportion.\n\nIndeed, the correct setup is P₁/V₁ = P₂/V₂, leading to P₂=(P₁V₂)/V₁.\n\nBecause in inverse variation, each pair multiplies to the same value.\n\nSo, better yet, express it as:\n\nSince P ∝ 1/V,\n\nso P₁/P₂ = V₂/V₁.\n\nCross-multiplied: P₁V₁ = P₂V₂.\n\nSame thing.\n\nSo, going back, calculating P₂=(P₁V₂)/V₁= (4*1.835)/3.67= approximates to 7.34/3.67=2.\n\nYes, that aligns with the first computation.\n\nWhereas attempting to equate P₁/(V₁)=P₂/(V₂) leads to incorrect results because it flips the relation.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that in inverse variation, multiplying P and V keeps the product constant, hence division requires maintaining the equality.\n\nTo prevent mistakes, always ensure that your algebraic manipulation maintains equivalence.\n\nMoreover, verifying calculations helps catch errors early.\n\nFor instance, checking 4*1.835 vs 2*3.67.\n\n4*1.835=7.34.\n\n2*3.67=7.34.\n\nThey match, confirming correctness.\n\nSimilarly, 8*1.835=14.68, whereas 4*3.67=14.68.\n\nConsistent.\n\nThus, concluding that the new pressure is 2 kPa.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2}\n</think>\n\nGiven that the pressure of a gas is inversely proportional to its volume at constant temperature, we use Boyle's Law \\( P_1 \\times V_1 = P_2 \\times V_2 \\).\n\nInitial conditions:\n- Initial volume \\( V_1 = 3.67 \\) liters\n- Initial pressure \\( P_1 = 4 \\) kPa\n\nNew conditions:\n- New volume \\( V_2 = 1.835 \\) liters\n- Final pressure \\( P_2 \\) is to be determined\n\nApplying Boyle's Law:\n\\[ P_1 \\times V_1 = P_2 \\times V_2 \\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\( P_2 \\):\n\\[ P_2 = \\frac{P_1 \\times V_1}{V_2} \\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ P_2 = \\frac{4 \\, \\text{kPa} \\times 3.67 \\, \\text{L}}{1.835 \\, \\text{L",

Hmm...\n\nWait no, maybe my initial thought was correct—since we're dealing with quadratic equations over rationals, then yes, the discriminant needs to be a perfect square because for sqrt(D), if you want it to produce an integer when divided into coefficients via quadratic formula, so yeah, discriminant should be a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, set up:\n\nD = b² -4ac\n\nIn our case,\n\nb=-7 => b²=49,\na=1,c=c,\n\nso D=49 -4c.\n\nWe require D=k², k∈ℕ.\n\nThus, 49 -k²=4c ⇒ c=(49 -k²)/4.\n\nSince c must be a positive integer, numerator must be divisible by 4, i.e., 49 -k² ≡0 mod4.\n\nCompute 49 modulo4: 49/4=12*4+1⇒49≡1mod4.\n\nSimilarly, k² mod4: squares mod4 are either 0 or1.\n\nBecause:\nIf k even: k=2m, k²=4m²≡0mod4;\nif k odd:k=2m+1,k²=4m(m+1)+1≡1mod4.\n\nHence, since 49≡1mod4, and k²≡0or1mod4.\n\nThen, 49 -k²≡(1)-0=1 or (1)-1=0 mod4.\n\nTo get 49 -k²≡0mod4, requires that k²≡1mod4, which implies k is odd.\n\nLet’s denote k as 2t+1,t≥0integer.\n\nSubstitute back:\n\nc=(49 -(2t+1)^2 ) /4.\n\nExpand denominator:\n\n(49 - (4t² +4t +1))/4=(48 -4t² -4t)/4= (48)/4 - t² -t=12 -t(t+1).\n\nSo, c=12 -t(t+1).\n\nNow, since c>0, 12 -t(t+1)>0 → t(t+1)<12.\n\nFind maximum t such that t(t+1)<12.\n\nTry t=3: 3*4=12→ Not less than 12; thus t≤2.\n\nCheck t from 0 upwards until inequality fails.\n\nFor t=0:c=12-0=12;\n\nt=1:c=12-(1)(2)=10;\n\nt=2:c=12-6=6;\n\nt=3:c=12-12=0 invalid.\n\nThus possible ts are 0,1,2 leading toc=12,10,6 respectively.\n\nAre these all?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps check other approaches.\n\nAnother way: Since c=(49 -k²)/4, and c must be positive integer, hence 4 divides 49 -k².\n\nAs above, k must be odd, say k=2t+1.\n\nPlug into expression:\n\nc=(49 - (4t² +4t +1))/4=(48 -4t² -4t)/4=12 -t² -t.\n\nWhich gives same result as before.\n\nLooking at c=12-t² -t, compute each term:\n\nAt t=0:12-0-0=12\n\nt=1:12-1-1=10\n\nt=2:12-4-2=6\n\nt=3:12-9-3=0invalid.\n\nIndeed, those are three solutions.\n\nIs there another approach?\n\nPerhaps factorizing the original equation.\n\nGiven x² -7x +c=0.\n\nSuppose factors are(x - p)(x - q)=x² - (p+q)x +pq.\n\nComparing to given eqn:x² -7x +c=0.\n\nThus,p + q=7, pq=c.\n\nNeed p,q integers (but actually they don't necessarily have to be integers unless c allows fractions... Wait, but earlier conclusion said discriminant needed to be perfect square, implying p and q would be rational numbers.)\n\nHowever, here, thinking differently, suppose p and q are integers. Then their sum is7, product isc.\n\nPossible pairs(p,q):\n\n(0,c):sum=c≠7 except c=7, but p*q=0 ≠7.\n\n(1,6):product=6;c=6.\n\n(2,5):product=10;c=10.\n\n(3,4):product=12;c=12.\n\nNegative ones:(-1,-6):-7 sum, product=6;c=6.\n\n(-2,-5):-7,sum, product=10;c=10.\n\n(-3,-4):-7,sum, product=12;c=12.\n\nOther combinations like non-integers may give different products, but without requiring p and q being integers.\n\nHmm, seems similar results.\n\nFrom previous method, got c=6,10,12.\n\nBut according to factoring, more possibilities exist.\n\nE.g., take pairings beyond integers.\n\nLike (sqrt(k),7-sqrt(k)), but leads to irrational c.\n\nUnless specific conditions on k make c integral.\n\nWait, but how does that relate?\n\nActually, regardless of whether p and q are integers or not, the condition comes down to discriminant being a perfect square.\n\nEarlier reasoning holds.\n\nThus, answer remains c=6,10,12.\n\nExpressed in decreasing order:12,10,6.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe positive integer values of \\( c \\) are \\(\\boxed{12}\\), \\(\\boxed{10}\\), and \\(\\boxed{6}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem of finding all positive integer values of \\( c \\) such that the equation \\( x^2 - 7x + c = 0 \\) only has roots that are real and rational, we start by noting that the discriminant of the quadratic equation must be a perfect square. \n\nThe discriminant \\( D \\) of the quadratic equation \\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\) is given by \\( D = b^2 - 4ac \\). For the given equation \\( x^2 - 7x + c = 0 \\), we have \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -7 \\), and \\( c = c \\). Thus, the discriminant is:\n\n\\[\nD = (-7)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot c = 49 - 4c\n\\]\n\nWe require \\( 49 - 4c \\) to be a perfect square. Let \\( k^2 = 49 - 4c \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer. Rearranging this equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n4c = 49 - k^2 \\implies c = \\frac{49 - k^2}{4}\n\\]\n\nFor \\( c \\) to be a positive integer, \\( 49 - k^2 \\) must be divisible by 4. We analyze the congruences modulo 4. Since \\( 49 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) and \\( k^2 \\) must satisfy \\( k^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\) (as shown below), we conclude that \\( k \\) must be odd. Let \\( k = 2t + 1 \\) where \\( t \\) is a non-negative integer. Substituting \\( k \\) into the equation for \\( c \\):\n\n\\[\nc = \\frac{49 - (2t + 1)^2}{4} = \\frac{49 - (4t^2 + 4t + 1)}{4} = \\frac{48 - 4t^2 - 4t}{4} = 12 - t(t + 1)\n\\]\n\nWe determine the valid values of \\( t \\) such that \\( c > 0 \\):\n\n- For \\( t = 0 \\): \\( c = 12 - 0 = 12 \\)\n- For \\( t = 1 \\): \\( c = 12 - 1 - 1 = 10 \\)\n- For \\( t = 2 \\): \\( c = 12 - 4 - 2 = 6 \\)\n\nValues of \\( t \\geq 3 \\) result in \\( c \\leq 0 \\), which are invalid.\n\nThus, the positive integer values of \\( c \\) are 12, 10, and 6. Expressed in decreasing order, these values are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}, \\boxed{10}, \\boxed{6}\n\\]",
