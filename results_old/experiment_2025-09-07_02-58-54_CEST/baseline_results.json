    "ground_truth_full": "The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.",

    "full_generated_solution": "1) Factor denominator:\n\nDenominator factors as (x + a)(x + b). So, we need to find two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to... Let's see...\n\nWait, I think you meant \"add up\" but in factoring quadratics like x²+bx+c, it should be adding c? Wait no—actually for quadratic ax²+bx+c=0 when factorizing into (mx+n)(px+r), m*p =a; n*r=c etc., so if leading coefficient is positive one here, then just looking at pairs multiplying to negative six which adds or subtracts depending on signs.\n\nSo back to original equation y=(2)/(x²+x−6).\n\nWe can write numerator as constant over same denominator since derivative isn't needed yet—it’s about finding zeros where function tends towards infinity because they are points where denominator approaches zero without being canceled by numerators.\n\nBut wait—the question specifically asks how many vertical asymptote(s)—so perhaps first determine whether any holes exist before considering asymptotes.\n\nHoles occur when both numerator and denominator share common roots—that would mean those values cause undefinedness due to cancellation rather than approaching infinite limits.\n\nIn our case, let me check if there exists an integer k such that f(k)=undefined while also making g(k)=zero—if yes, hole otherwise not present.\n\nGiven f(x)=(numerator)/denominator, assuming linear terms maybe—but actually given only polynomial expressions, unless specified more details—I might assume standard functions.\n\nLooking again:y=(2)/(x²+x−6)\n\nFirstly, compute discriminant D=b²–4ac\n\nHere, coefficients from denominator:x² term has coeff 1, middle term 'b' is 1, last term '-6'\n\nThus,D=1 –(4*1*(-6))=1 +24=25>0→two real distinct roots →no repeated root meaning denominators don’t cancel out completely—they’re different.\n\nTherefore, all potential poles will result in Vertical Asymptotes except possibly some cases where multiple roots could lead to higher multiplicities—in particular multiplicity greater than one may affect behavior near certain point—for example, even though technically each simple pole contributes separately regardless of their order—as long as none coincide.\n\nSince Denominator doesn't repeat its own prime factors beyond what was already considered—we know these are separate single-pole singularities hence number of V.A.s equaling degree of denominator minus something else…wait hold on…\n\nActually, general rule says Number of vertical asymptotes equals total zeroes of denominator excluding ones cancelling via division—which requires checking GCD between numerator and denominator polynomials—isn't necessary now because Numerator is constant 2 whereas denominator is quadratic whose possible rational roots include ±1,±2,etc.—but likely won't divide evenly.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is simply solving set denominator ≠0 i.e solve x² +x −6≠0.\n\nWhich leads us directly to solution steps above.\n\nLet me proceed methodically:\n\nStep 1: Find domain restrictions based on denominator.\nSet denominator !=0:\nx² +x −6!=0\nFactorize denominator expression:\nFind integers p,q s.t.p*q=-6,p+q=1(because cross-term)\nPossible options:(p,q): (-3,+2),(3,-2)... But sum must be 1?\n(-3)+(+2)= -1 Not matching desired sum (+/-).\nSimilarly,(3)+( -2 )=1 Yes! That works!\n\nYes, correct pairings:p=3 q=-2 gives product -6 & sum 1.\n\nThen,\nx² +x −6 =(x³?) No,\n\nWait correction: It's written correctly earlier.\n\nIt becomes (x +3 )(x -2 )\n\nBecause expanding (x+a)(x+b):\n\nIf a*b=(-6);and a + b=1.\n\nAs found,a=3,b=-2 satisfies ab=-6 anda +b=1.Thus,x² +x −6=(x +3)(x −2 ).\n\nGreat, thus denominator factors as (x +3)(x −2 ). Therefore, setting them unequal to zero implies solutions x≠-3;x≠2.\n\nThese correspond to vertical asymptotes provided neither cancels nor causes removable discontinuities.\n\nNow, do either of these make numerator zero too? The numerator is always 2, never zero. Thus, cannot create cancellations—hence, every time denominator crosses zero, function goes toward +/-infinity causing respective vertical asymptotes.\n\nMoreover, note that after simplifying fraction,you get partial fractions decomposition,but important thing remains is count of unique roots in denominator apart from multiples.\n\nHowever, double-checking: Since denominator had exactly twovariableroots,each giving rise to individualverticalasymptotes.Therefore,totalnumberofV.A.Sisequaltothecountoffoundatoredenominatorequationrootsthat aren't sharedwith nume rator.\n\nAndsince numerator didn't provideanyzeros,and denomi nitorhasexactlytwotwodistinctrealzerosthenumberofoverallv.a.sthis equal to2.\n\nIs my reasoning sound?\n\nAlternative way: Solve denominator=x² +x −6=0⇒x=[−1 ±√(1 +24)]/2 =[−1 ±5]/2 ⇒x=(4)/2=2&x=(−6)/2=−3.Hence,v.a.atx=2 andx=−3.Thus,numberof v.as istw o.\n\nI believe answer is\\boxed{2}\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe graph of \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\) has \\(\\boxed{2}\\) vertical asymptotes.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how many vertical asymptotes the graph of \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\) has, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the denominator**: \n   The denominator is \\( x^2 + x - 6 \\).\n\n2. **Factor the denominator**:\n   We look for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to 1. These numbers are 3 and -2. Thus, the denominator factors as:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the critical points**:\n   Set each factor of the denominator equal to zero:\n   \\[\n   x + 3 = 0 \\implies x = -3\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x - 2 = 0 \\implies x = 2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Check for removable discontinuities**:\n   There are no common factors between the numerator (which is 2) and the denominator, indicating no removable discontinuities.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Each value of \\( x \\) that makes the denominator zero results in a vertical asymptote. Therefore, the graph has two vertical asymptotes at \\( x = -3 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n### Final Answer\nThe graph of \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\) has \\(\\boxed{2}\\) vertical asymptotes.",

Let's do it carefully.\n\nFirstly, substituting x from eq(2) into inequality from eq(1), which is:\n\n(\\dfrac{23}{7} - n) > n - 1\n\nYes? Because if I replace x in Ineq(1) where x must be greater than n-1.\n\nBut wait no—hold on—the substitution should actually lead us to an expression involving only constants or fractions without variables because eventually our goal is solving for integer 'n' since ceil(x)=n implies n is integer?\n\nAh! That makes sense now. Since floor functions result integers but here specifically using ceiling so maybe similar approach can work.\n\nTherefore let's proceed accordingly.\n\nStarting again after defining n=ceiling(x),\n\nWe know that n−1<x≤n.\n\nAlso, given that x=(23/7)-n.\n\nThus replacing x gives:\n\n(n − 1)< (23/7 – n) ≤n\n\nThis creates two separate inequalities:\n\nLeft side first:\n\n(n − 1) < (23/7 – n )\n\nBring all like terms together:\n\nAdd n both sides:\n\n2n −1 < 23 /7\n\nMultiply numerator denominator appropriately perhaps not necessary yet; just keep going.\n\nSimilarly right side second inequality:\n\n(23/7 – n ) <=n\n\nAgain bring over same term:\n\n23/7<=2n\n\nOkay, these are key steps leading towards finding possible values of n.\n\nGiven that n has to satisfy both left and right conditions above.\n\nCompute each part separately.\n\nFor Left Side First:\n\n2n −1 < 23/7\nAdding 1 to both sides:\n\n2n < 23/7 +1 => convert 1 to 7/7 then add up numerators:\n\n23+7)/7=>30/7\n\nHence:\n\n2n<30/7 → divide both sides by 2→n<15/7≈2.14286\n\nSince n was defined earlier as being at least something due to definition via ceiling function.\n\nSpecifically, recall that when you take ceiling of x=n, meaning x>=n-1 and less thann.\n\nMoreover, considering real numbers, unless specified otherwise, usually assume non-negative reals except possibly negative ones—but depending upon context.\n\nHowever, looking back at initial equations, summing ceiled value plus itself equals positive number 23/7 (~3.2857)—so likely x could also be fractional positive—if any constraints were mentioned about positivity—it wasn't stated explicitly though sometimes problems implicitly require positives—as per usual conventions.\n\nAssuming x>0 would make more sense especially adding its own ceiling equaling another positive quantity.\n\nIf x had been allowed negatives too, there might've been multiple solutions—for example, suppose x=-k where k>0, then ceiling(-k)=floor(k)+something else—I think need to check whether assuming x≥0 helps avoid complications.\n\nAlternatively, proceeding under assumption x ≥0 may help simplify things further.\n\nProceeding thus, knowing n needs to be >= some lower bound based on definitions.\n\nLooking at Right Side Second Inequality:\n\n23/7 <=2n ⇒ Multiply through denominators etc., but better express directly:\n\nDivide both sides by 2⇒23/(7*2)<=n⇒23/14 ≈1.6429 <=n\n\nEarlier found n < ~2.14286\n\nCombined results:\n\nLower Bound:n >=~1.6429\n\nUpper Bound:n <~2.14286\n\nAdditionally,n∈ℤbecause n=⌈x⌉and ceilings map ℝto ℤ.Thus, what integer lies between approximately 1.6429 and approximates 2.14286 ?\n\nOnly possibility is n=2.\n\nBecause next higher integer beyond upper limit isn’t included—in other words, interval [approx1.6429, approx2.14286] includes exactly one integer, namely 2.\n\nPerfecto!\n\nConfirming calculations once again quickly:\n\nStarts off correctly defines n= ⌈x⌉, hence n ∈ℕ∪{0}, typically starting counting from zero, although depends on convention.\n\nWith substitutions done properly, arrived at bounds around 1.6429 to 2.14286 inclusive.\n\nThe only integer within those limits is indeed 2.\n\nGreat progress.\n\nHaving determined n=2，now compute x.\n\nRecall from previous substitution:x=23/7–n=23/7–2=23/7–14/7=9/7。\n\nCheck validity.\n\nIs x=9/7 satisfies condition that n=⌈x⌉=2？\n\nIndeed,x=9/7≈1.2857… Which is certainly larger than 1 (=n−1=1) and smaller than 2 (since x=1.2857..<2)，thus satisfying n=2。Good.\n\nFurthermore verify the main equation：\n\nCeil(x) +x =(2)+(9/7)=(14/7 +9/7)=23/7——which matches RHS perfectly.\n\nAll checks out nicely.\n\nConclusion：x=9⁄7 expressed as a common fraction.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\boxed{\\dfrac{9}{7}}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\(\\lceil x \\rceil + x = \\dfrac{23}{7}\\), we start by denoting \\(n = \\lceil x \\rceil\\).

I need to figure out how many terms are there between each number? Wait no, that might not be necessary here because we're dealing with an arithmetic progression where you can use formulas directly without counting individual differences unless needed later on.\n\nFirst off, identifying if it’s arithmetic or geometric makes sense since both have specific patterns. In our case, looking at consecutive numbers:\n\nFrom 6 to 10: difference is +4\n\nThen from 10 to 14: also +4\n\nSimilarly, next would be another +4... So yes, common difference d=+4 which means its definitely an Arithmetic Progression.\n\nGot it down as AP now. Next part is finding the general formula for any given term, specifically the 100th one.\n\nI remember something about linear equations being used when modeling sequences like these—since they increase by equal amounts each time. The standard form should look similar to y = mx + b but adjusted accordingly for sequences starting somewhere else instead of zero.\n\nSo perhaps using point-slope form could help us derive the equation once we know two points—the first few terms—and then extrapolate beyond them.\n\nLet me write down some known values:\n- When n=1, a_1=6\n- When n=2, a_2=10\n- When n=3, a_3=14\nAnd so forth...\n\nSince it's an arithmetic sequence, knowing just the initial term and the common difference allows writing the explicit formula easily.\n\nThe key idea behind such problems often lies within recognizing whether it fits into either recursive or closed-form expressions based on their nature—as opposed to trying to count steps manually—which isn't efficient especially considering large indices like 100.\n\nBut before jumping straight into recursion, maybe recalling the concept helps better understand why certain methods work—for example, expressing the relationship through algebraic manipulation rather than iterative addition.\n\nWait, actually thinking back—if someone were stuck calculating up all those terms until reaching 100—it'd take forever! Instead, having a straightforward mathematical model saves tons of time during exams or real-world applications alike.\n\nTherefore, moving forward towards deriving the correct expression seems essential even though sometimes overcomplicating things may seem tempting initially; however, stepping away will prevent confusion.\n\nNow focusing again onto constructing the right formula—isn’t the basic structure of an arithmetic series simply defined by adding multiples of the common difference 'd' every single term after the previous one starts.\n\nIn other words, the second term is obtained by adding 'd' to the first term,\n\nThird term adds 'd' twice,\nFourth term three times,...\n\nHence, more formally, the nth term can be expressed as:\n\na_n = a₁ + (n - 1) * d\n\nWhere:\n- \\( a_{n} \\): nth term of the sequence\n- \\( a_{1} \\): First term\n- \\( d \\): Common Difference Between Terms\n- \\( n \\): Term Number\n\nYes, exactly!\n\nGiven that information, plugging in the provided data gives confidence building upon solid ground.\n\nLooking at Problem Statement again:\n\nWe’re asked for the 100th term (\\( a_{100} \\)) of the arithmetic sequence starting at 6 with a common difference of 4.\n\nThus, substituting everything correctly according to variables above:\n\n\\( a_{100} = 6 + (100 - 1)*4 \\)\n\nCalculates to:\n\nCompute inside parenthesis first: 99*4\n\nWhich equals 396\n\nAdd to original value: 6 + 396 = 402\n\nHmm… wait—that leads me to think my calculation was too quick—but hold on—I want to double-check due diligence.\n\nAlternatively, verifying via alternative method ensures correctness regardless of approach taken.\n\nAnother way to compute \\( a_n \\):\n\nStarts at 6, increases by 4 each subsequent term.\n\nNumber of increments required to reach the 100th term—from start—we must add 4 ninety-nine times (because going from term 1 to term 2 requires one increment).\n\nTotal added amount: 4 multiplied by 99 → same result as earlier computation.\n\nIndeed, 4 × 99 = ?\n\nWell, breaking it down further: 4×100 – 4×1 = 400–4=396\n\nAdding to the base term 6 yields total sum of 402 indeed.\n\nTo ensure thoroughness, cross-verifying calculations across different methodologies reinforces accuracy.\n\nYet another perspective comes mind regarding summation notation—a classic tool in mathematics—to express cumulative additions systematically yet concisely.\n\nExpressed differently, the entire process can be written as follows:\n\nSumming the incremental contributions made per position relative to the beginning.\n\nEach new term contributes four units compared to prior ones excepting the very first unit itself.\n\nMathematically, representing Summations:\n\n\\[\na_{100} = 6 + \\sum_{k=1}^{99}{4}\n\\]\n\nHerein, k represents the index variable indicating the number of iterations performed—in essence, traversing past the first element while accumulating ninety-nine instances of additive fours.\n\nComputing the summation portion separately:\n\nCalculate ∑ₖ¹⁰⁹⁹ 4 =\n\nThat simplifies neatly to 4*(number_of_terms), i.e., 4*99=396\n\nAgain leading to identical conclusion: 6 + 396 = 402\n\nConsistently arriving at the same numerical outcome underscores the reliability of multiple approaches employed throughout various stages of learning.\n\nMoreover, reflecting deeper insight reveals underlying principles governing progressions—an important takeaway for future reference.\n\nUnderstanding that arithmetic sequences follow predictable structures allow students to tackle seemingly complex tasks efficiently—even under timed conditions—with minimal effort—or conversely, enabling oneself to recognize potential pitfalls early-onwards.\n\nHowever, crucially, avoiding rote memorization necessitates comprehending derivation processes—not merely reciting definitions verbatim.\n\nThis exercise has thus been designed primarily to reinforce comprehension alongside procedural fluency concerning fundamental concepts related to arithmetic sequences.\n\nAdditionally, practicing alternate solution techniques enhances adaptability—one who encounters varied questions needing application of knowledge gains versatility.\n\nReturning to primary objective: computing the 100th term accurately.\n\nHaving gone through several verification paths—all pointing toward consistent results—they serve as robust evidence supporting trustworthiness in final output.\n\nFinal check against simple cases verifies consistency:\n\nFor instance, checking small-term behavior aligns well with expected outcomes.\n\nTerm 1: 6 ✔️ Correct.\n\nTerm 2: 10 ✔️ As computed previously.\n\nTerm 3: 14 ✔️ Also matches expectation.\n\nContinuing similarly, say term 5: Starting from 6, plus 4 thrice→6+(4x3)=18✔️ Which corresponds precisely to the third sample input presented originally.\n\nAll tests pass smoothly confirming internal validity.\n\nConsequently, confident stating that the calculated 100th term stands firm at 402.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe 100th term of the arithmetic sequence is \\boxed{402}.\n</think>\n\nIdentify the type of sequence: It is an arithmetic sequence because the difference between consecutive terms is constant (common difference \\(d = 4\\)).\n\nFind the formula for the nth term (\\(a_n\\)):\n\\[ a_n = a_1 + (n -

    "full_generated_solution": " Step by step explanation...\n\nAlright, so I have to solve the inequality \\( x^2 - 5x - 4 \\leq 10 \\). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst off, inequalities can sometimes be tricky because you might need to consider multiple cases or manipulate them differently than equations. But usually, for quadratic expressions like this one, moving all terms to one side makes sense first. So maybe subtracting 10 from both sides will help simplify things a bit?\n\nLet's try that:\n\n\\( x^2 - 5x - 4 - 10 \\leq 10 - 10 \\)\n\nWhich simplifies down to:\n\n\\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\leq 0 \\)\n\nOkay, now we've got a standard quadratic expression on the left-hand side which needs to be less than or equal to zero. To find where this holds true, perhaps factoring would work here since if we factor correctly, finding roots could give us critical points around which intervals are positive or negative.\n\nSo let's attempt to factor \\( x^2 - 5x - 14 \\).\n\nLooking at factors of -14... Well, considering pairs:\n- (7)(-2) = -14\nAnd adding up those numbers gives +5.\nWait no, actually when multiplying two binomials as such,\n\nIf our middle term was supposed to come out after expansion,\nso looking for something like (x + a)(x + b), but wait, original equation has coefficient -5 instead of just summing 'a' and 'b'.\n\nAlternatively, using FOIL method backwards.\n\nWe want coefficients such that their product is c (-14) and they add up to d (-5).\nHmm, trying different combinations...\nFactors of -14 include:\n(1, -14): Sum is -13\n\n(-1, 14): Sum is 13\n\n(2, -7): Sum is -5\n\nAh! There we go!\n\nYes, indeed; 2 * (-7) equals -14, and 2 + (-7) equals -5 exactly matching the linear term.\n\nTherefore, the trinomial factors into:\n\n(x + 2)(x - 7) ≤ 0\n\nGreat, so far so good. Now, next thing is determining where each factor changes sign—i.e., its zeros—and then testing intervals between these zeros to see whether the entire expression is non-positive there.\n\nThe solutions set comes back to solving an inequality involving products being <= 0. That happens either when one factor is positive while another is negative OR when both factors themselves are zero—but given that equality occurs only at specific points, not over ranges unless overlapping regions exist.\n\nBut before getting too deep into test intervals, though—it’s always helpful—to note the key points—the boundaries where f(x)=0 occur at x=-2 and x=7.\n\nThese divide the real number line into three distinct open/closed intervals depending upon inclusion/exclusion based on signs within each region.\n\nSpecifically, breaking it down:\n\n1. Interval A: Negative infinity < x < -2\n   Here, plug any value say x=-3 into (x+2):\n      Since x=-3< -2 => (x+2)<0  \n     And plugging same into (x-7):\n       x=-3<-7=> Wait hold on, isn't x approaching towards more negatives?\n        Actually, hang on—if x approaches very low, e.g., x=-10, \n         Then (x+2)= -8 (<0)\n          Similarly, (x-7)= -17(<0)\n          Therefore, Product=(negative)*(negative)=(positive)=> Positive>0\n    Which doesn’t satisfy the inequality<=0 condition.\n\n2. Interval B: Between -2 and 7\nHere, pick some point inside—for example,x=0\nThen,(x+2)=2 (>0),\nand (x-7)= -7 (<0)\nThus, Their product becomes (+)*(-)=Negative≤0→ satisfies the inequality.\n\nSimilarly, take midpoint somewhere else, say x=5:\n(x+2)=7 >0;\n(x−7)= −2 <0 → again, product is negative.\n\nAt endpoints:\n\nWhen x=-2:(x+2)=0*(x−7)= also 0*something=0⇒ meets boundary conditions.\n\nSame way, When x=7: Both factors become zero ⇒ Again meeting the criteria.\n\nNow beyond endpoint x=7 onwards:\n\nTake x=8∈Interval C:x=8>\nCompute (x+2)=10 (>0); (x−7)=1 (>0);\nProduct=Positive≥0≠ required.\n\nHence, summarizing:\n\nInequality satisfied in [B] : [-2 ,7]\n\nIncluding the exact bounds due to \"less than or equal\" operator.\n\nTo confirm my steps were correct:\n\nStarting with initial inequality:\n\nOriginal Ineq.: \\( x² -5x -4 ≤10\\ )\n\nSubtracted 10 throughout leading to new quadric form:\n\nQuadratic simplified to \\( x² -5x -14 ≤0 \\\n\nFactored via trial found roots at x=-2 & x=7 hence expressed as (x+2)(x-7)<=0\n\nTested various intervals determined solution lies between -2 inclusive and 7 inclusive.\n\nExpressed result in interval notation accordingly.\n\nI don't spot anything wrong in reasoning process nor calculation errors during cross-checks.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe solution is \\(\\boxed{\\left[ -2,\\ 7 \\right]}\\).\n</think>\n\nTo solve the inequality \\( x^2 - 5x - 4 \\le 10 \\):\n\n1. Subtract 10 from both sides to get:\n   \\[\n   x^2 - 5x - 14 \\le 0\n   \\]\n\n2. Factor the quadratic expression:\n   \\[\n   (x + 2)(x - 7) \\le 0\n   \\]\n\n3. Determine the critical points where the expression equals zero: \\( x = -2 \\) and \\( x = 7 \\).\n\n4. Test the intervals divided by these critical points:\n   - For \\( x < -2 \\), choose \\( x = -3 \\): The product is positive.\n   - For \\( -2 < x < 7 \\), choose \\( x = 0 \\): The product is negative.\n   - For \\( x > 7 \\), choose \\( x = 8 \\): The product is positive.\n\nSince the inequality requires the product to be less than or equal to zero, the valid intervals are where the product is negative or zero, i.e., between -2 and 7 including the endpoints.\n\nThus, the solution in interval notation is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\left[ -2,\\ 7 \\right]}\n\\]",

Maybe my formula for part two was wrong too.\n\nLet me try again:\n\nAfter one year:\nA₁ = P*(1 + r)\nAfter two years:\nA₂ = A₁*(1 + r) = [P*(1 + r)] * (1 + r) = P*(1 + r)^2\n\nSo yes, over n periods of length T, where period=yearly,\nthe total multiplier would be (1+r)^n,\n\nTherefore, if we have continuous compounding, but since our case uses discrete yearly compounded rates, then indeed, the general form should be A(t)=P*(1 +r*t).\n\nBut wait no—wait! That’s only true when you’re getting simple interest per annum—but actually, more accurately, Compound Interest Formula is different from what I thought earlier.\n\nActually, let me recall correctly—the standard compound interest formula is given by:\n\nAmount = Principal × (1 + Rate/Number_of Periods)^(Number_of_Points)\n\nIn this scenario, Number_ofPeriods equals Time—in whole number terms—if invested once every year, so N=P×T=(1+R*T), assuming R% is converted into decimals first.\n\nYes, okay, now back to Problem Statement.\n\nMr. Madoff Invests $1000 in Fund Compounded Annually At Constant Rate 'r' As Decimal.

Since It's Compounded Annually, hence multiplying thrice.\n\nThus,A=P*(1 + r)^t => 1225=1000*(1 + r)^3\n\nHence,(1 + r)^3=1225 / 1000=1.225\n\nThen take cube root both sides:(1 + r)=(1.225)^(1/3)\n\nCompute Cube Root Of 1.225 Approximately.\n\nWhat Value Equals approximately When Cubed Gives ~1.225.\n\nWell-known cubes are:\n\n- 1^3=1\n\n- 1.1^3≈1.331>1.225→Too high.\n\nTry lower value:\n\nMaybe around .987 ?\n\nBecause 1.224 approximates close to some known fraction perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, use logarithms maybe better approach.\n\nTake natural log Both Sides:\n\nln((1 + r))= ln(1.225)/3 ≈ (approximate calculation needed )\n\nCalculate ln(1.225):\n\nApproximately, e^{x}=y → x=y - y²/(2)+....\n\ne.g., For small increments above 1, say delta_x such that exp(delta_x )~delta_y.\n\nHere,y=1.225,delta_y=0.225.\n\nAssuming delta_x <<1, approximate expansion gives δx ≈ ΔY – (Δ Y)^2 / 2.\n\nWhich leads us to compute Delta X ≈ 0.225 − (0.225)^2 / 2 ≈ 0.225−0.0256≈0.1994.\n\nSimilarly,e^{-something},but not necessary right away.\n\nInstead, remember that Natural Logarithm(ln(y)),for numbers between 1 and higher than 1.\n\nFor example, ln(1.225): Using calculator-like approximation methods.\n\nSince exact computation might require precise tools beyond manual calculations, alternatively note that sqrt(1.225)=approximately 1.107 ,since 1.1 squared is 1.21 which is less than 1.225, while next square is about 1.21*1.21=~1.4641,which overshoots.\n\nAnyway, knowing that √1.225≈1.107,so√sqrt(1.225)=cube_root(1.225)= roughly somewhere near 1.07.\n\nWait, another way: If i know that 1.07 cubed is equal to how much?\n\nCalculating 1.07³ manually:\n\n1.07 ×1.07=1.1449;\n\nthen multiply by 1.07:\n\n1.1449 ×1.07 =\n\nMultiply 1.1449 ×1=1.1449;\n1.1449 ×0.07=0.080143；\nAdd together:1.1449 +0.080143=1.225043。\n\nWow!\n\nExactly matching 1.225.\n\nThat means that (1.07)^3=1.225 exactly.\n\nWhoa!!!

So according to our knowledge about such problems, perhaps certain properties hold regarding their relationships or averages.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering some algebraic manipulation would help.\n\nI remember reading somewhere that sometimes adding up multiple equations gives useful information—for example, taking several sums together could lead to expressions involving individual variables multiplied twice plus something else equals total across different groupings—but not sure how applicable that is right now.\n\nAnother thought—if instead of trying random approaches, let's assume specific values based on known techniques—or recall similar past problems—and see whether they apply directly here.\n\nHmm... Alternatively, since dealing with small sets like four elements seems manageable, perhaps listing out potential candidates isn't too bad after all.\n\nSo first off, note down all the required sums: 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, 29.\n\nThese must correspond precisely to the results of combining any two among the four integers a,b,c,d into pairs.\n\nGiven that, my initial idea was probably correct—that once sorted numerically, arranging accordingly will give insight.\n\nMoreover, thinking back to standard methods used elsewhere—it often involves calculating totals and using average relations—to figure out missing pieces.\n\nPerhaps starting by computing the overall sum of all the provided sums—which should equal three times the sum of the original four integers—a key point!\n\nYes! Because every number appears in exactly three pairs—one being paired against each other element except itself—in effect, each variable contributes thrice its value towards the grand total.\n\nTherefore, compute Σs_i=3(a+b+c+d). Then divide appropriately later.\n\nCalculations:\nSumming the given s_i: 10 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 29\n\nCompute sequentially:\n\nStart with 10+18=28\nThen add 19→28+19=47\nAdd next 20 →47+20=67\nNext 21→67+21=88\nFinally, 29 adds to get 88+29=117.\n\nThus, Sum_s = 117 ⇒ Therefore,\n\nTotal_sum_of_all_numbers ×3 = Total_sum_s⇒ Thus,\nsum_{a,b,c,d}=117/3=39.\n\nOkay, got that established—all four numbers' combined sum is 39.\n\nNow moving forward—we need to find exact numerical assignments for a,b,c,d knowing also that when summed in pairs produce specified intermediate steps.\n\nSince the minimal sum is likely achieved via the two smaller numbers, while maximal comes through the largest ones.\n\nLooking at the data points: The lowest sum is 10, highest is 29.\n\nAssuming ordering correctly, suppose minima come from lower-numbered terms.\n\nHence, possibly assuming that 'a', followed by b, c, d arranged increasingly.\n\nMeaning, a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d.\n\nWhich implies that the minimum sum isa + b=10.\n\nSimilarly, maximum sum isc + d=29.\n\nThat leaves middle-summed possibilities.\n\nThe second-lowest sum may either be a + c or b + c depending upon relative sizes.\n\nLikewise, similarly, third-highest sum would depend on arrangement.\n\nHowever, rather than guessing blindly, better proceed systematically.\n\nWe know that:\n\n- Minimal Pair : a + b =10\n\nMaximal Pair:c + d=29\n\nMiddle Pairs: We'll have remaining sums:18,19,20,21.\n\nNote that fourth-pair(s): Wait, originally, before grouping, had six sums including both sides.\n\nNope, sorry, initially, the user wrote “the sums 10, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 29” —so indeed, ordered ascendingly, [10,18,19,20,21,29].\n\nIn reality, though, the actual process requires figuring out who goes where.\n\nAn alternative method called the \"pairwise\" analysis uses formulas related to symmetric functions.\n\nSpecifically, denoting x,y,z,w as the four numbers in non-decreasing order(x≤y≤z≤w).\n\nTheir pairwise sums include xy,xz,xw,yz,yx(w),zw.\n\nOrder-wise, arrange these sums as per size.\n\nFrom prior reasoning, the smallest sum isxy=x+y=10andlargest zw=z+w=29.\n\nOther sums lie mid-way around.\n\nTo determine y+z=(xz)+something...\n\nActually, recalling formulae relating mean etc., but alternatively, use system of equation solving.\n\nSuppose define p=a+b,q=b+c,r=c+d,s=d+a,t=something… Hmm, getting confused.\n\nAlternative plan inspired by linear systems:\n\nIf we take the following notation:\n\nPair sums:\n\np = a + b\n\nq = a + c\n\nr = a + d\n\ns = b + c\n\nt = b + d\n\nu = c + d\n\nAnd sort them in increasing order: Given u > t>s> r>p=q ?\n\nNot necessarily, depends on specifics.\n\nBut regardless, having seven sums listed earlier.\n\nOur goal is reconstructing the four numbers a,b,c,d whose respective pairwise additions match the given sums.\n\nOne way is to assign labels to the various sums and solve simultaneously.\n\nFor instance, label the sums as follows:\n\nSmallest sum:p=a+b=10\n\nSecond-smallest q=r=? Or whatever.\n\nThird-somme:s=?, Fourth-t=..., fifth-u=..., sixth=v=w=29.\n\nThis becomes complicated unless structured properly.\n\nInstead, refer to mathematical literature suggesting systematic ways to extract quartet solutions.\n\nUpon reflection, remembering that in general case, n(n−1)/2 sums relate uniquely to quadratics.\n\nIndeed, treating the quadratic form ax² + bx + c=y^2,...\n\nAlternately, recognizing that the differences between consecutive sums yield clues.\n\nE.g.: If subtract adjacent sums, e.g., difference between max and others yields info.\n\nYet, stepping aside, perhaps best route is trial-and-error coupled with logical deduction.\n\nFirst, establish basic constraints.\n\nAs previously noted,a + b=10 anda + w=?? Not yet clear.\n\nAlso, c + d=29.\n\nAdditionally, looking at the medium-sized sums: For example, say, the median term is approximately halfway between low and high ends.\n\nAverage of extremes:(10 +29)=39 /2≈19.5. Hence, expected medians near ~20.\n\nExamining the available sums: They range roughly from10–29.\n\nMedian position lies midway—isn’t quite precise due to even count, but suggests central tendency approximates~20.\n\nAmongst the five middling sums:18,19,20,21,20,… Well, most importantly, notice that 20 occurs twice.\n\nPossibly indicating duplicate contributions or overlapping conditions.\n\nFurthermore, noting that higher-than-average sums tend to involve larger components.\n\nConsidering that, hypothesize that the large component includes z and w.\n\nBecause z + w=29, already identified.\n\nWhat remains is determining z - w.\n\nWell, potentially helpful.\n\nMoving further, observe that the biggest gap exists between 21 and29, implying significant jump toward upper side.\n\nWhereas gaps below indicate progression upward.\n\nDifferences between successive sums:\n\nBetween 10 &18:+8\n\n18&19:+1\n\n19&20:+1\n\n20&21:+1\n\n21&29:+8\n\nInteresting pattern—notably repeated increments.\n\nIt hints symmetry concerning distributional positions.\n\nFurther thoughts suggest that the sequence has symmetrical jumps upwards/downwards.\n\nSuch patterns typically occur when numbers themselves follow arithmetic progressions.\n\nIs that plausible?\n\nMaybe yes—as otherwise, why do the increases repeat?\n\nAlternate line of attack: Assume that the four numbers consist of two pairs differing minimally apart.\n\nLike, imagine a situation wherex andx+k appear equally spaced within the dataset.\n\nThough uncertain.\n\nBacktracking, focus on defining variables.\n\nDefine:\n\nFour Numbers:a <= b<=c<=d\n\nKnown:\n\na + b=10 ...(i)\nc + d=29...(ii)\nNeed additional Equations.\n\nConsider cross-multiplications:\n\nAdding Equation(i)+(ii):\n\na + b + c + d=39 => From previous calculation.\n\nOKay, Now aimto express other sums intermsof existing quantities.\n\nPossible Approach:\n\nExpress unknown Variables(certainly expressed in terms of a,b,c,d.)\n\nList All Possible Pair-Wise Combinations:\n\nPairs:\n\n(ab),(ac),(ad),\n\n(bc),(bd),\n\n(cd)\n\nCorrespondingly, Their Values Are Known As:\n\nValues:[10,18,19,20,21,29]\n\nSorted Order[10,18,19,20,21,29], hence corresponding to:\n\nEither mapping ab=10, rest assigned progressively.\n\nOr assigning differently.\n\nPotentially tricky partis assignment matching.\n\nApproach:\n\nAssign Lower Bounds First.\n\nSet ab=minimun sum=10.\n\nUpper Bound=max sum=29.\n\nRemaining Middle Terms: To Assign Remaining Five Sums:18,19,20,21,20。\n\nWait, hangon, duplicates exist--two instances of20.\n\nAh, important clue.\n\nTwo occurrences imply duplication in calculations.\n\nProbably arisingfrom same contribution.\n\nHow does duplicity happen?\n\nTypical scenario arisesif two identical products arisedue to duplicated factors.\n\nExample:x*y=x*z=>then y≠zbut product still same.\n\nBut unlikely in simple cases.\n\nAlternatively, Maybe Two Different Products Leading Same Value.\n\nBut difficult.\n\nAnyway, proceeding under assumption that necessary deductions require careful handling.\n\nProceeding thus：\n\nHaving defined ab=10 and cd=29.\n\nLeftover sums:18,19,20,21.\n\nThey're spread amongst ac, ad, bc, bd.\n\nNumber of Leftovers:four sums left.\n\nVariables involved:three new variables: namely, a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d.\n\nBut cannot map immediately.\n\nPotential Idea：Use Averaging Methodology.\n\nCalculate Average of Each Variable.\n\nRecall that Mean of entire Set =(total)/(number of items)=(39)/4=9.75.\n\nApproximately nine.sixty-seven-five.\n\nDoes that assist anything?\n\nAlternatively，consider variance concepts,but unsure.\n\nMethodologically, Perhaps Express Other Relationships.\n\nNotice that:\n\n(ac + bd )/(bc + ad )\n\nCould provide ratio-based relation.\n\nBut unclear direction.\n\nAlternatively, Consider Adding Specific Equations.\n\nTake Eqs:\n\nEquation(I):a + b=10\n\nEquation(ii):c + d=29\n\nOthers:Etc.\n\nThink about expressing everything in terms of single variables.\n\nSay, fix a parameterization.\n\nIntroduce parameters k,m,n,o representing offsets.\n\nBut complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, Think About Quadratic Forms.\n\nFormulate Quartic Polynomial Where Roots Correspond to Integers.\n\nBut sounds abstract.\n\nRe-examizing Problem Statement:\n\nFind four Distinct Integers a,b,c,d Such That When Added In Pairs, Results Obtained Exactly These Six Sums:10,18,19,20,21,29.\n\nQuestion Is asking for Increasing Ordering Of This Set.\n\nThinking Backward, Since Max And Min Already Identified, Focus On Finding Midrange Elements.\n\nMid-range Between Minimum and Maximum: (10 +29)/2=19.5.\n\nThus, Median Around There.\n\nObservantive Note: Looking At Available Sums, Medians Include 20 Which Is Closest to Central Tendancy.\n\nConversely, Another Thought Process: Suppose Arrange Sorted List Of Pair-Sum Data Points.\n\nAlready Have Smaller Ones:10, Next Likely Could Be Either a + c or b + c.\n\nDepending Upon Size.\n\nCompare With Medium One:18 vs 19.\n\nAgain, It Might Indicate Whether a + c=18 or b + c=18.\n\nSame logic applies for subsequent Steps.\n\nContinuing along Lines:\n\nAfter establishing ab=10 and cd=29, Need to Determine ac, ad, bc, bd.\n\nAvailable Pair Sums:18,19,20,21.\n\nArrange Them in Ascending Order:18,19,20,21.\n\nAttempt Matching Potential Positions.\n\nCase 1: Assuming ac=18.\n\nLeads Ac=18.\n\nWith ab=10, Subtract Both Equations:\n\nSubtract ac – ab=18 –10=8.\n\nResult: c – b=8.\n\nKnowing Alsothat b + c= ???.

The given equation is:\n\n$$\n\\left|x\\right| = \\frac{|3x + 2|}\n{\\sqrt{x^2}}\nWait no, hold on! Let me read it again carefully because sometimes when problems mention \"absolute,\" they can be tricky depending on how you interpret them.\n\nThe original question says:\n\"What is the smallest value of \\( x \\) such that \\( |5x - 1| = |3x + 2| \\)?\"\n\nSo yeah, we're dealing directly with two expressions inside their own absolute values being set equal each other without any denominators or square roots involved except within those absolute functions themselves—wait, actually looking at my initial thought process here... Wait, let's see if there was an error earlier about whether sqrt(x²). Hmm, but wait—the user wrote down his solution steps which included dividing both sides by something—it seems like he might not even need division since one side has just another expression over itself?\n\nBut perhaps more accurately, maybe someone else would think differently—if instead, considering all variables squared under the root—but regardless, according to standard algebraic principles, taking into account cases based upon signs could lead us through different scenarios rather than complicating things unnecessarily.\n\nLet’s get back—I initially misread; now correcting myself—isn't the denominator part only present once per term? So, originally, after writing out correctly,\n\nthe right-hand side (RHS), before simplifying further, should probably remain intact unless instructed otherwise—that is, RHS isn’t necessarily divided by anything beyond its current form—as opposed to having some variable exponentials etc.—but okay, moving forward.\n\nGiven that, our starting point remains straightforward:\n\nWe’re told that\n\n\\( |5x - 1| = |3x + 2| \\)\n\nTo find real numbers x satisfying this equality, remember from basic properties of absolute equations that either:\n\nCase 1: Both inner expressions are positive AND equal,\nOR Case 2: One is negative while the corresponding outer sign flips accordingly.\n\nAlternatively phrased using mathematical definitions:\n\nEither \n\na) \\( 5x - 1 = 3x + 2 \\)\nor \nb) \\( -(5x - 1) = 3x + 2 \\).\n\nThese correspond respectively to situations where both quantities were non-negative leading to same result, versus opposite directions resulting in negatives cancelling appropriately.\n\nTherefore, solving these linear equations will give potential solutions whose validity must then be checked against domain considerations—in particular regarding domains related to logarithms or radicals—which aren't applicable here due to the nature of absolute functionality—they inherently consider magnitude irrespective of direction.\n\nThus, proceeding methodically:\n\nFirstly, write Equation A):\n\nEquation A):  \nLeft Side equals Right Side via addition property.\nHence, case 1 leads to:\n\n(5x − 1) = (3x + 2 )\n\nSubtracting 3x across terms gives:\n\n5x−3x=2+1 => 2x=3 ⇒ x=3/2.\n\nSecondly, handle case b):\nHere, left-side becomes minus LeftSide, hence:\n\n-(5x – 1 ) = 3x + 2 → (-5x +1)=3x +2\n\nBring similar terms together:\n\n-5x–3x=2–1→ -8x=1⇒ x=-1/8.\n\nNow, check both results obtained satisfy the conditions imposed by Cases a & b above—are valid—or do require additional scrutiny—for example, ensuring neither LHS nor RHS become undefined during substitution—and also checking positivity constraints implicitly required by Absolute Value Equations.\n\nHowever, note that in reality, setting up the system doesn't impose explicit restrictions besides what comes naturally from equating magnitudes—a key insight!\n\nIn fact, typically, whenever handling absolute-value equations, especially ones involving single-variable polynomials, quadratic-like structures may emerge post-squaring operations, though often squaring introduces extraneous solutions requiring verification.\n\nYet, importantly, in pure absolute-values setup, particularly simple forms, cross-multiplication approaches don't usually necessitate expanding squares until necessary—to avoid complications introduced later.\n\nMoreover, verifying the found solutions ensures correctness.\n\nProceeding thus:\n\nFrom first scenario, x=3/2≈1.5.\n\nCheck plugging back into Original Expression:\n\nCompute |5*(3/2)-1|=|(7.5)-1|=6.5 vs compute |3*(3/2)+2|=|(4.5)+2|=6.5. Thus, yes, holds true.\n\nSimilarly second Scenario:x=-1/8 ≈-0.125.\n\nPlug-in:\n\nCalculate |5*(-1/8)-1|=|-0.625 -1|= |-1.625|=1.625;\n\nOn R.H.S., calculate |3*(-1/8)+2|=|-0.375 +2|=|1.625|=1.625.\n\nAgain, matches perfectly. Therefore, both solutions seem legitimate.\n\nSince the Problem asks specifically for the Smallest VALUE OF X, among possible Solutions, between Negative Infinity and Positive infinity, obviously, fractions' ordering matters.\n\nLooking at computed answers,x=3/2 (~1.5)and x=-1/8(~-0.125); clearly,-1/8 < 3/2.Therefore, minimal Solution is x=-1/8.\n\nIs There Any Other Possibility Or Mistake Here?\n\nWell, double-check calculations:\n\nFor First Solving Processed Correctness:\n\nStarting Point:\n\nOriginal Eq.: |5x -1|=|3x +2|\n\nSet Equalities:\n\nOptionally, split into Two Cases:\n\nA:) 5x -1 = 3x +2 ; B:) 5x -1 = - (3x +2 ).\n\nWhich yields Option A.) : Solve For x:\n\n5x -1 = 3x +2 --> Subtract 3x: 2x -1 =2--> Add 1: 2x=3--->x=3/2.\n\nCorrect.\n\nB.):- (5x -1 )=3x +2 ==> Multiply Out: -5x +1=3x +2==> Bring Variables Over:\n\nAdd 5x: 1=8x +2=> subtract 2: -1=8x=> divide By 8: x=(-1)/8.\n\nYes correct.\n\nThen verify Each Solved x satisfies Equality Condition.\n\nAs done previously, plug In Values Back Into Original Eqs And Confirm They Hold True.\n\nBoth work.Thus,Solutions Are Valid.\n\nAdditionally, Since Quadratic-Type Problems Can Have Multiple Roots But Only Some Of Them May Fit Contextually, However, As We've Done Above, All Found Root Checkers Work Hence No Extra Steps Required.\n\nConclusion:The Minimal x Is At Least Between These Two Points Which Arises From Different Directions On Either Endof Number Line.\n\nIndeed, x=-1/8is Less Than x=3/2，so It's The Minimum.\n\nFinal Answer:\\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{1}{8}}\\)。\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe smallest value of \\( x \\) is \\boxed{-\\dfrac{1}{8}}.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the equation \\( |5x - 1| = |3x + 2| \\), we start by recognizing that absolute value equations can be solved by considering two main cases: when the expressions inside the absolute values are equal, or when one is the negation of the other.\n\n### Key Steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Cases:**\n   - Case 1: \\( 5x - 1 = 3x + 2 \\)\n     - Simplifies to: \\( 2x = 3 \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{3}{2} \\)\n   - Case 2: \\( -(5x - 1) = 3x + 2 \\)\n     - Simplifies to: \\( -5x + 1 = 3x + 2 \\Rightarrow -8x = 1 \\Rightarrow x = -\\frac{1}{8} \\)\n\n2. **Verify the Solutions:**\n   - Substitute \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\) into the original equation:\n     - Compute \\( |5(\\frac{3}{2}) - 1| = |\\frac{15}{2} - 1| = |\\frac{13}{2}| = \\frac{13}{2} \\)\n     - Compute \\( |3(\\frac{3}{2}) + 2| = |\\frac{9}{2} + 2| = |\\frac{13}{2}| = \\frac{13}{2} \\)\n     - Both sides match, confirming \\( x = \\frac{3}{2} \\).\n   \n   - Substitute \\( x = -\\frac{1}{8} \\) into the original equation:\n     - Compute \\( |5(-\\frac{1}{8}) - 1| = |-\\frac{5}{8} - 1| = |-\\frac{13}{8}| = \\frac{13}{8} \\)\n     - Compute \\( |3(-\\frac{1}{8}) + 2| = |-\\frac{3}{8} + 2| = |\\frac{13}{8}| = \\frac{13}{8} \\)\n     - Both sides match, confirming \\( x = -\\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n3. **Determine the Smallest Value:**\n   - Compare \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\approx 1.5 \\) and \\( -\\frac{1}{8} \\approx -0.125 \\).\n   - Clearly, \\( -\\frac{1}{8} \\) is smaller.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe smallest value of \\( x \\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{1}{8}}\\).",
