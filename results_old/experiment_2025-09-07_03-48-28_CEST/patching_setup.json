    "source_prompt": " Step by step explanation...\nAlright, so I have to figure out for how many real numbers x the expression sqrt(120 - sqrt(x)) becomes an integer. Hmm... Let me break it down slowly because sometimes these nested square roots can be tricky.\n\nFirst off, let's denote that sqrt(120 - sqrt(x)) equals some integer k. So we're saying:\n\nk = sqrt(120 - sqrt(x))\n\nSince both sides are non-negative (because a square root result must be zero or positive), squaring both sides should help eliminate the outermost radical. That gives us:\n\n(k)^2 = 120 - sqrt(x)\n\nWhich simplifies further as:\n\nk^2 + sqrt(x) = 120\n\nWait no—that would actually make sense if you rearrange terms differently? Wait maybe not exactly; hold on—let me write each equation clearly again after substitution.\n\nStarting from:\nsqrt(120 - sqrt(x)) = k\nThen,\nSquare both sides:\n120 - sqrt(x) = k²\nSo then solving for sqrt(x):\nsqrt(x) = 120 - k²\n\nNow since sqrt(x) has to equal something here—it’s under another square root in our original function—but wait, originally inside was sqrt(x). But now, once squared away, what do we know about its domain?\n\nLet me think—if sqrt(x) exists, which requires x >= 0. Then when taking sqrt(sqrt(x)), but hang on—the initial question says \"for how many real values of x\"—so perhaps even though there might seem restrictions later, they still count within those domains where everything makes sense.\n\nBut stepping back—I've got two equations right now:\n\nFrom above,\n\nEquation A: sqrt(x) = 120 - k²\n\nAnd Equation B comes into play through substituting earlier steps—isn't Equations already solved except possibly regarding constraints on variables like being integers etc.—but okay...\n\nAlso important point: Since all radicals need their arguments to satisfy certain conditions—for example, expressions inside squares cannot be negative unless specified otherwise—they’re defined only over specific intervals depending on whether the radicand needs to stay non-negative throughout multiple layers.\n\nIn particular, starting inner layer first: The term sqrt(x)—this implies that x itself must be greater than or equal to zero—in other words, x ∈ [0, ∞).\n\nNext level up: Inside the second square root, before subtracting anything else—we had 120 minus sqrt(x); thus, regardless of any operations outside, whatever lies underneath every single one of them also must remain ≥ 0.\n\nTherefore, breaking it down more carefully:\n\nWe start at the very top: We take sqrt(y), say y=..., such that z=sqrt(w)=something—and ultimately want w≥0 everywhere along the way without introducing negatives anywhere until finally arriving at the final value needed—which is just given via equality conditionally based upon previous results.\n\nThus, going backwards—from my current state—with sqrt(x):\n\nI found that sqrt(x) = 120 - k².\n\nGiven that sqrt(x) is always non-negative—as per definition—all quantities involved must comply accordingly.\n\nHence, considering sqrt(x)'s requirement:\n\nsqrt(x) ≥ 0 ⇒ 120 - k² ≥ 0 → Therefore, 120 - k² ≥ 0 => k² ≤ 120.\n\nAdditionally, note that while working backward, beyond getting sqrt(x) expressed in terms of k, remember that sqrt(x) inherently depends on x having been previously considered valid due to prior definitions.\n\nMoreover, moving forward towards expressing things algebraically may require ensuring consistency across different substitutions.\n\nHowever, looking ahead, knowing that k is supposed to produce an integer output—a key insight—to find possible integral solutions for k will limit potential candidates significantly.\n\nBecause initially, someone could approach trying various ks, compute corresponding xs, check feasibility, but instead, better yet, formalize using inequalities derived from necessary conditions.\n\nOkay, putting together thoughts:\n\nStep 1: Express sqrt(120 - sqrt(x}) ) as integer k.\nThat leads to sqrt(120 - sqrt(x)} )) = k ==> Squared version yields 120 - sqrt(x) } = k² ==> Thus, sqrt(x) } = 120 - k² }\n\nAs established, therefore, sqrt(x) must be less than or equal to 120, obviously, but strictly speaking, sqrt(x) must be between 0 and infinity, inclusive.\n\nSimilarly, plugging back into sqrt(x): If sqrt(x}=120−k²}, then necessarily, 120 − k² > 0 ? Because sqrt(x) is nonnegative, hence 120 – k² must be nonnegative too! Otherwise, sqrt(x) wouldn’t exist—or rather, technically undefined.\n\nAh yes indeed!\n\nMeaning that 120 – k² ≥ 0 --> Hence, same conclusion as before: k² <= 120.\n\nFurthermore, importantly, since sqrt(x) is present, meaning x must lie somewhere in R_{>=0}. However, does that impose additional constraints besides k²<=120 ?\n\nWell, suppose hypothetically that somehow during calculation, although theoretically allowed, resulting in invalidity elsewhere—not sure.\n\nAlternatively, thinking deeper—are there cases where despite satisfying k²≤120, computing sqrt(x) causes issues downstream?\n\nFor instance, consider evaluating sqrt(x}: It's required that x is non-negative, i.e., x∈[0,infty}; however, supposingly, if computed correctly, nothing wrong occurs.\n\nAnother thought arises: When dealing with functions involving compositions of square roots, especially nesting ones deep enough, care must be taken concerning continuity/monotonicity properties, but probably unnecessary here.\n\nMoving onward, next consideration is determining permissible integer values of k.\n\nNote that k represents sqrt(... ), which means k must be a non-negative integer.
