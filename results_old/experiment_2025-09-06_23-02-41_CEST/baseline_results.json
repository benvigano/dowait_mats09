    "ground_truth_full": "The denominator of the rational function factors into $x^2+x-6=(x-2)(x+3)$. Since the numerator is always nonzero, there is a vertical asymptote whenever the denominator is $0$, which occurs for $x = 2$ and $x = -3$.  Therefore, the graph has $\\boxed{2}$ vertical asymptotes.",
    "ground_truth_answer": "2",
    "full_generated_solution": "1\n\nWait, I think that's wrong because when x approaches -3 from above or below... Wait no...\n\nHmm, maybe my initial thought is correct? Hmm.\nAlright, let me try to figure out how many vertical asymptotes the function \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\) has.\n\nFirst off, vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator equals zero but the numerator doesn't. So, we need to find all real solutions for the equation:\n\n\\( x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \\)\n\nTo solve a quadratic equation like this, I can factor it if possible. Let's see if two numbers multiply to give -6 and add up to 1 (the coefficient of x). \n\nThe factors of -6 are:\n- (-1, 6)\n- (1, -6)\n- (-2, 3)\n- (2, -3)\n\nLooking at these pairs, which pair adds up to 1?\nLet's check each one:\n- (-1) + 6 = 5\n- 1 + (-6) = -5\n- (-2) + 3 = 1 → Yes!\n\nSo, the middle term breaks down into -2x and 3x. Therefore, factoring gives us:\n\n\\( x^2 + x - 6 = (x - 2)(x + 3) \\)\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the roots:\n\n1. \\( x - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 2 \\)\n2. \\( x + 3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -3 \\)\n\nTherefore, the denominator becomes zero at x = 2 and x = -3. Since neither of these makes the numerator zero (numerator here is just 2), both x=2 and x=-3 will result in vertical asymptotes.\n\nHence, there are **two** vertical asymptotes.\n\nBut wait! The original solution said \"1\" as an answer. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nHold on, perhaps I misread the question. It says \"How many vertical asymptotes...\" But sometimes people confuse horizontal and vertical asymptotes. Maybe they only considered something else?\n\nNo, looking back, the function is definitely rational since it's a polynomial divided by another polynomial. Vertical asymptotes come from zeros of the denominator not canceled by zeros of the numerator.\n\nIn our case, after factoring, denominator zeroes are at x=2 and x=-3; numerator isn't zero anywhere except possibly infinity near those points—so yes, indeed, two vertical asymptotes.\n\nAlternatively, could someone mistakenly count them differently? For example, thinking about multiplicity or considering left/right limits—but even so, multiplicities don’t affect whether it’s an asymptote—it affects behavior around the point.\n\nThus, unless there was some error in solving the quadratic, which seems straightforward, then two should be correct.\n\nMaybe initially, I thought 'wait why am I doubting myself'—but actually, double-checking shows two vertical asymptotes exist.\n\nPerhaps the confusion arises between counting different types of discontinuities, such as removable vs. non-removable ones, but in this case, none are removable because plugging any value into the numerator won't nullify the denominator.\n\nAnother angle: Sometimes problems might present functions without simplifying denominators first, leading you to incorrectly factor. However, in this case, the denominator is already given as \\( x^2 + x - 6 \\); hence, factoring directly applies.\n\nJust making sure I didn't miss anything—the key steps were identifying the denominator, setting it equal to zero, finding its roots, ensuring they aren't also roots of the numerator—which wasn't the case here.\n\nYeah, solid conclusion: Two vertical asymptotes.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{2}\n</think>\n\nVertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of a rational function equals zero while the numerator does not. To determine the number of vertical asymptotes for the function \\( y = \\frac{2}{x^2 + x - 6} \\), we need to solve the equation:\n\n\\[ x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \\]\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation, we get:\n\n\\[ x^2 + x - 6 = (x - 2)(x + 3) \\]\n\nSetting each factor equal to zero gives the roots:\n\n1. \\( x - 2 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = 2 \\)\n2. \\( x + 3 = 0 \\Rightarrow x = -3 \\)\n\nSince neither \\( x = 2 \\) nor \\( x = -3 \\) makes the numerator zero, both values result in vertical asymptotes. Therefore, the function has two vertical asymptotes.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]",

Let me think about it again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Euler's formula could help, treating i as e^(iπ/2). But I don't know if that would simplify things more than just dealing directly with complex numbers' properties.\n\nHmm... Maybe breaking down each exponent step by step?\n\nLet me try calculating each term individually.\n\nFirst Term: \\(i^5\\)\n\nI remember that \\(i\\) cycles every four powers: \\(i^0=1\\), \\(i^1=i\\), \\(i^2=-1\\), \\(i^3=-i\\), then repeats.

Hmm, okay, let me see how to solve it step by step. \n\nFirst off, I remember that when dealing with exponential equations like this one, a good strategy might be to express both sides using the same base if possible. That way, since the bases are now consistent, we can equate their exponents directly. So, looking at my equation, on the left side, everything's already in base 2—\\(2\\) raised to some power. On the right side though, instead of being base 2, it’s written as \\(4^x\\), which isn't quite helpful yet because 4 is another number—it's actually \\(2^2\\).\n\nWait, maybe I should rewrite \\(4^x\\) in terms of base 2? Yeah, that makes sense. Because then both sides will have the same base, making it easier to compare them or manipulate further. Let me try that out.\n\nSo starting again with the original equation:\n\\[2^8 = 4^x\\]\n\nI know that \\(4\\) is equivalent to \\(2^2\\), so substituting that into the equation gives us:\n\\[2^8 = (2^2)^x\\]\n\nNow, there's an exponent rule where raising a power to another power multiplies the exponents. In mathematical terms, \\((a^m)^n = a^{mn}\\). Applying that here, the right-hand side becomes:\n\\[2^{2x}\\]\n\nOkay, so after simplifying, our equation looks like:\n\\[2^8 = 2^{2x}\\]\n\nSince both sides have the same base, which is 2, we can set the exponents equal to each other. This comes from the property that if \\(a^b = a^c\\), then \\(b = c\\), provided that \\(a\\) is not zero or one. Here, \\(a = 2\\), which satisfies those conditions.\n\nSetting the exponents equal:\n\\[8 = 2x\\]\n\nTo find the value of \\(x\\), all I need to do next is divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\\[\\frac{8}{2} = x\\]\nWhich simplifies to:\n\\[4 = x\\]\n\nTherefore, solving for \\(x\\) gives us \\(x = 4\\).\n\nLet me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn’t skip anything important or make any mistakes.

    "full_generated_solution": " ... [continues...]\nAlright, so I've got this problem here where Mr. Madoff invested $1000 in a fund that compounds annually at a certain interest rate. After three years, it grew to $1225. They want me to find out what that annual interest rate is, rounded to the nearest whole number percent. Okay, let's break this down step by step because sometimes these compound interest problems can be tricky if you're not careful.\n\nFirst off, I remember there are different formulas for simple interest versus compound interest. Since this one says \"compounds annually,\" which means each year the amount gets multiplied by the same factor based on the interest rate. So instead of just adding some fixed amount every period like simple interest does, we have compounding, meaning the growth happens more frequently—every year in this case.\n\nThe formula for compound interest that comes to mind is A equals P times (1 plus r) raised to the power of n, right? Where:\n- A is the amount after time,\n- P is the principal amount (the initial investment),\n- r is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),\n- n is the number of years.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers from our problem into this equation should help us solve for r. Let me write that out:\n\nA = P(1 + r)^n\n\nWe know that A is $1225, P is $1000, and n is 3 since it's compounded annually over three years. Plugging those values in gives:\n\n1225 = 1000*(1 + r)^3\n\nOkay, now my goal is to solve for r. To do that, first, I think I need to isolate (1 + r). That would mean dividing both sides of the equation by 1000. Let me try doing that:\n\nDivide both sides by 1000:\n1225 / 1000 = (1 + r)^3\nWhich simplifies to:\n1.225 = (1 + r)^3\n\nNow, to get rid of that exponent, I'll take the cube root of both sides. Cube roots might seem intimidating, but they aren't too bad once you get used to them. The cube root of something cubed is just itself. So taking the cube root of both sides:\n\nCube_root(1.225) = 1 + r\n\nHmm, okay, calculating the cube root of 1.225 seems necessary. Maybe using logarithms or estimation could work here. Alternatively, perhaps recognizing that 1.225 is close to a perfect cube?\n\nWait, hold on—if I recall correctly, 1.07^3 is approximately equal to 1.225649. Because when you calculate 1.07 * 1.07, that’s about 1.1449, then multiplying again by 1.07 gives roughly 1.2256. Hmm! So maybe 1.07 is the approximate value needed here.\n\nLet me verify that calculation:\n\nCompute 1.07 × 1.07:\n= (1 + 0.07)(1 + 0.07)\nUsing FOIL method:\n= 1*1 + 1*0.07 + 0.07*1 + 0.07*0.07\n= 1 + 0.07 + 0.07 + 0.0049\nAdding up all terms:\n1 + 0.07 + 0.07 = 1.14; 1.14 + 0.0049 ≈ 1.1449\n\nThen multiply 1.1449 by 1.07:\nAgain, use FOIL:\n1.1449 × 1.07\nMultiply term by term:\n1×1.1449 = 1.1449\n0.07×1.1449 = approx 0.080143\nAdd together: 1.1449 + 0.080143 ≈ 1.225043\n\nWow, exactly matching 1.225! So that must mean that 1.07 is indeed the correct value for (1 + r), making r equal to 0.07, which is 7%.\n\nBut wait, before finalizing that conclusion, let me make sure everything adds up properly without any mistakes.\n\nStarting with $1000, applying an annual interest rate of 7% for three years. Each year, the amount grows by 7%. Let's compute it manually step-by-step to confirm whether it actually results in $1225.\n\nYear 1:\n$1000 * 1.07 = $1070\n\nYear 2:\n$1070 * 1.07. Let's see, 1070 * 1.07.\nWell, 1000 * 1.07 is 1070, and 70 * 1.07 is 74.9, so total is 1070 + 74.9 = $1144.90\n\nYear 3:\n$1144.90 * 1.07. Again, breaking it down:\n1000 becomes 1144.90, so 1000 part will grow to 1000 * 1.07 = 1070, while 144.90 * 1.07 needs computation.\n\nCalculating 144.90 * 1.07:\n144.90 * 1 = 144.90\n144.90 * 0.07 = ~10.143\nTotaling 144.90 + 10.143 = 155.043\n\nTherefore, Year 3 total is 1070 + 155.043 = $1225.043, which rounds to $1225. Perfect!\n\nHence, confirming that r is indeed 7%, given that starting with $1000, growing at 7% per annum, compounded annually, leads to $1225 after three years.\n\nAlternatively, another way to approach this problem is through trial and error, trying different percentages until the result matches. But considering how quickly exponential functions increase, even small errors in approximation can lead to significant discrepancies later on, especially over multiple periods. Therefore, algebraic methods such as setting up equations and solving via inverse operations are much more efficient.\n\nAnother thought process someone might go through is thinking about why the question specifies rounding to the nearest integer. It probably wants a precise enough solution without having to deal with fractions beyond integers, hence relying on exact calculations rather than estimating intermediate steps.\n\nAlso, reflecting back on the original problem statement—it mentions that the investment compounds annually, so knowing that makes sense—the key was remembering the compound interest formula and being able",

What are the four integers in increasing order? (place a comma and then a space between each integer)\n\nSolution: ",
    "ground_truth_full": "WLOG, let $a<b<c<d$. The smallest sum is $a+b=10$. The second-smallest sum is $a+c=18$. The second-largest sum is $b+d=21$. The largest sum is $c+d=29$. In summary, \\begin{align*}\\tag{1}\na+b&=10\\\\ \\tag{2}\na+c&=18\\\\ \\tag{3}\nb+d&=21\\\\ \\tag{4}\nc+d&=29\n\\end{align*} There are two sums left, $a+d$ and $b+c$. We will break this problem into two cases, the first case in which the first of the two sums is smaller than the second, and the second case in which the first of the two sums is larger than the second.\n\nIn the first case \\begin{align*} \\tag{5}\na+d&=19\\\\ \\tag{6}\nb+c&=20\n\\end{align*} Adding Equations (1) and (6) and subtracting (2), we have $(a+b)+(b+c)-(a+c)=10+20-18\\Rightarrow b = 6$.

Plugging the value of $c$ into Equation (4), we find that $14+d=29 \\Rightarrow d=15$.

    "full_generated_solution": "1) Let’s define variables for the smallest sum as s = a + b < t = a + c < u = a + d < v = b + c < w = b + d < x = c + d.\n2) From equation 3), we get p = q - r where p is one of these equations...\nWait, maybe I need to think differently... Maybe it's better to consider all possible pairings...\n\nAlternatively, perhaps listing out all possible pairwise sums from given numbers can help identify which ones correspond to individual terms.\n\nGiven that there are six unique sums, let me try assigning them systematically:\n\nLet S be the set {s, t, u, v, w, x}, sorted increasingly.\n\nWe know that the minimal element in S must be equal to the sum of two smallest elements among a,b,c,d; similarly, the maximal element will be the sum of the largest two.\n\nSo first step: find min(S)=10 and max(S)=29.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number plus next smallest equals 10, but wait no—actually, if you sort the original numbers, say a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d, their pairwise sums would range from a+b up to c+d.\n\nThus, indeed, min(S)=a+b=10, and max(S)=c+d=29.\n\nNow, considering the second smallest sum, which should be either a+c or b+a depending on how they compare. But since a≤b≤c<d, so a+c could potentially be less than b+a only if c<a, which isn't true because c≥b>a. So actually, a+c > a+b=a+ something bigger?\n\nWait, hold on—if a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d, then adding smaller numbers together gives lower sums. Therefore, the second smallest sum after a+b=s=10 should probably be a+c=t=18.\n\nSimilarly, the third smallest might be another combination like b+c=u=19, fourth being b+d=v=20, fifth possibly c+d=w=21, sixth being ... Wait, not sure yet.\n\nBut according to my initial thought process, the user tried defining variables for different combinations and got confused later. Perhaps an alternative approach is needed here.\n\nAnother idea: The total of all pairwise sums is equal to 3*(a + b + c + d). Since there are C(4,2)=6 sums provided, add them up and divide by 3 to get the total sum of the four numbers.\n\nCompute the sum of given sums: 10 + 18 + 19 + 20 + 21 + 29.\n\nCalculate:\n10 + 18 = 28\n28 + 19 = 47\n47 + 20 = 67\n67 + 21 = 88\n88 + 29 = 117\n\nTotal sum of all pairwise sums is 117. Thus,\n\n(a + b + c + d)*3 = 117 => a + b + c + d = 39.\n\nOkay, now knowing that, what else do we know about the individual numbers?\n\nFrom earlier steps, we had:\n\n- Minimal sum: a + b = 10,\n- Maximal sum: c + d = 29,\n- Total sum: a + b + c + d = 39.\n\nSubtracting the minimal sum from the total sum gives us c + d - (a + b) = 29 - 10 = 19.\n\nWhich also corresponds to our previous variable definitions—it makes sense.\n\nAdditionally, looking at other sums, such as the second smallest sum, which was supposed to be a + c. If we assume that ordering correctly, then a + c should come before any larger sum involving higher numbers.\n\nIf a + b =10, and suppose a + c=18, then subtracting those two equations:\n\n(a + c) - (a + b) = 18 - 10 ⇒ c - b = 8.\n\nAlso, note that c + d =29.\n\nSince c - b =8, then b = c -8.\n\nAnd since a + b =10, substituting b into that:\n\na + (c -8 ) =10 ⇒ a + c =18.\n\nHmm, okay, consistent.\n\nThen moving forward, perhaps trying to express more relationships.\n\nWhat about the next sum, which is 19. Is that going to be a + d or b + c?\n\nAssuming that a + d comes before b + c, meaning a + d < b + c.\n\nIs that necessarily always the case? Hmm, depends on whether d is significantly larger than c compared to b.\n\nNot entirely clear without further information.\n\nPerhaps instead, using known values.\n\nSuppose we denote:\n\nEquation 1: a + b =10.\n\nEquation 2: a + c =18.\n\nEquation 3: Then, Equation 4: ?\n\nWait, maybe stepping back.\n\nAfter getting Equations 1 and 2, we found that c - b =8.\n\nMoreover, since a + c =18, and a + b=10, so difference between c and b is 8.\n\nFurthermore, c + d=29.\n\nSo, if we write down expressions for a, b, c, d in terms of others.\n\nFrom Equation 1: a =10 - b.\n\nFrom Equation 2: c =18 - a =18 -(10 - b)=8 + b.\n\nHence, c =8 + b.\n\nFrom above, c - b=8, which holds.\n\nGood, consistency check passed.\n\nNext, let's look at the remaining sums: 19, 20, 21, 29.\n\nThese include some middle-sized sums.\n\nLooking again, the three medium-sums: 19, 20, 21.\n\nI wonder if these correspond to a + d, b + c, and b + d respectively.\n\nBecause a + d may be somewhere around mid-range, while b + c is likely similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps arranging based on size.\n\nFirstly, list all the sums:\n\nSorted: 10,18,19,20,21,29.\n\nKnown:\n\nSum1: a + b =10.\n\nSum2: a + c=18.\n\nSum3: Next candidate is a + d or b + c.\n\nTo figure out which is Sum3, let's see.\n\nThe next sum after 18 is 19.\n\nPossible candidates: Either a + d or b + c.\n\nAssume a + d=19.\n\nCheck if feasible.\n\nIf a + d=19, then d=19 -a.\n\nBut remember that a + b=10, so a=10 - b.\n\nPlug into expression for d:\n\nd=19 - (10 - b)=9 + b.\n\nOK, keep track.\n\nOther possibilities: Alternatively, b + c=? If a + d=19, does that conflict anything?\n\nWell, proceed assuming a + d=19.\n\nProceeding:\n\nSum3: a + d=19.\n\nSum4: Could be b + c or b + d.\n\nDepending on value.\n\nContinuing.\n\nOnce we've",
