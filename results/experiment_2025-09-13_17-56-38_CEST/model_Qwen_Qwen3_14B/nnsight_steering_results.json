        "ground_truth":"4",
        "baseline_prefix":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many integer divisors the number 7 has. Let me start by recalling what a divisor is. A divisor of a number is an integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder. So, for example, 2 is a divisor of 4 because 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is an integer. But 3 isn't a divisor of 4 because 4 divided by 3 is not an integer.\n\nNow, the number in question here is 7. Let me think about the divisors of 7. Well, first, I know that 1 is a divisor of every number because any number divided by 1 is itself. So 1 is definitely a divisor of 7. Similarly, the number itself, which is 7, is also a divisor of 7 because 7 divided by 7 is 1, which is an integer.\n\nNow, are there any other divisors? Let me check. Let's consider numbers between 1 and 7. Let's test each one:\n\n- 2: 7 divided by 2 is 3.5, which is not an integer. So 2 is not a divisor.\n- 3: 7 divided by 3 is approximately 2.333... Not an integer. Not a divisor.\n- 4: 7 divided by 4 is 1.75. Nope.\n- 5: 7 divided by 5 is 1.4. Still not an integer.\n- 6: 7 divided by 6 is about 1.166... Not an integer.\n\nSo none of the numbers between 2 and 6 divide 7 evenly. What about numbers larger than 7? Well, if I take 8, 9, etc., dividing 7 by those numbers would result in fractions less than 1, which aren't integers. So those aren't divisors either.\n\nBut wait, do I need to consider negative integers as well? The problem says \"integer divisors,\" and integers include both positive and negative numbers. So, for example, -1 and -7 would also divide 7 because 7 divided by -1 is -7, which is an integer, and 7 divided by -7 is -1, which is also an integer.\n\nSo, if I include negative divisors, then the divisors of 7 would be -7, -1, 1, and 7. That's four divisors. But hold on, sometimes when people ask for the number of divisors, they might be referring to positive divisors only. Let me check the problem statement again. It says \"integer divisors,\" which technically includes both positive and negative. However, in mathematics, sometimes the term \"divisors\" can be context-dependent. For example, in number theory, divisors are often considered positive unless stated otherwise.\n\nBut the problem specifically says \"integer divisors,\" so maybe they want all integers, positive and negative. However, I need to be careful here. Let me think again. If we consider the definition, a divisor of an integer n is an integer m such that there exists an integer k where n = m*k. So, for example, both 1 and -1 divide 7 because 7 = 1*7 and 7 = (-1)*(-7). Similarly, 7 and -7 divide 7 because 7 = 7*1 and 7 = (-7)*(-1). Therefore, the integer divisors of 7 are indeed -7, -1, 1, and 7. That's four divisors.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in problems like this, unless specified otherwise, they might be asking for positive divisors. Let me check if there's a standard convention. In many math problems, especially in contexts like the number of divisors of a number, it's usually referring to positive divisors. For example, when we talk about the number of divisors of a number in the context of prime factorization or something like that, it's typically positive integers. However, the problem here says \"integer divisors,\" which is more explicit. So if we take it literally, it's all integers, positive and negative.\n\nBut maybe the problem is from a source where they consider only positive divisors. Let me think. For example, if this is a problem from a math competition or a textbook chapter that's discussing positive divisors, then the answer might be 2. However, if it's from a context where negative divisors are considered, then the answer is 4.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact wording again. The problem says \"How many integer divisors does 7 have?\" The term \"integer divisors\" is a bit ambiguous. However, in mathematics, the term \"divisor\" can refer to both positive and negative integers unless restricted. However, in many cases, especially in problems like this, unless specified, they might be referring to positive divisors. For example, when you look up the number of divisors of a number, it's usually the positive ones. For example, the number 7 is a prime number, and it has two positive divisors: 1 and 7. If negative divisors are included, then it's four.\n\nBut since the problem says \"integer divisors,\" which includes negatives, but maybe the answer expected is 2. However, I need to be precise here. Let me check with definitions.\n\nAccording to mathematical definitions, a divisor of an integer n is an integer m such that n divided by m is an integer. So, for example, the divisors of 7 are all integers m where 7\/m is an integer. So m can be 1, -1, 7, -7. Therefore, there are four integer divisors.\n\nBut maybe the problem is in a context where only positive divisors are considered. However, since the problem says \"integer divisors,\" not \"positive integer divisors,\" I think the answer should be 4. However, I need to check if there's a standard in math problems. For example, in the context of the GRE or SAT or other standardized tests, when they ask for the number of divisors, they usually mean positive divisors. However, since the problem is presented in a more general way, perhaps from a math competition or a general math problem, it's safer to consider both positive and negative.\n\nBut let me think again. If the problem is from a source that is following the standard mathematical definition, then the answer is 4. However, if it's following a convention where divisors are positive, then the answer is 2. Since the problem says \"integer divisors,\" I think it's safer to go with the mathematical definition which includes negatives. However, I need to check if there's a way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the context of the positive integers. For example, in the context of the number of divisors function, which is usually defined for positive integers and counts positive divisors. However, the problem says \"integer divisors,\" which is more general.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a math competition like the AMC, where usually divisors are considered positive unless stated otherwise. For example, in the AMC problems, when they ask for the number of divisors, they mean positive divisors. Therefore, if this is similar, the answer would be 2.\n\nBut since the problem is presented in isolation, without context, I need to make an educated guess. However, given that 7 is a prime number, and primes have exactly two positive divisors, 1 and themselves. Therefore, if the problem is following that convention, the answer is 2. However, if negative divisors are considered, then it's 4.\n\nBut the problem says \"integer divisors,\" so maybe the answer is 4. However, I need to check if there's a standard in mathematics. For example, in the definition of divisors in number theory, divisors can be negative. For example, in the Wikipedia article on divisors, it says: \"In mathematics, a divisor of an integer n, also called a factor of n, is an integer m that may be multiplied by some integer to produce n.\" So, for example, -1 is a divisor of 7 because (-1) * (-7) = 7. Therefore, according to this definition, there are four divisors: -7, -1, 1, 7.\n\nHowever, in many cases, especially in problems where the number of divisors is asked, it's usually referring to positive divisors. For example, the number of positive divisors of 7 is 2. But the problem says \"integer divisors,\" which would include negatives. Therefore, the answer is 4.\n\nBut maybe the problem is from a source where they consider only positive divisors. However, since the problem says \"integer divisors,\" not \"positive integer divisors,\" I think the answer is 4. However, I need to check if there's a way to confirm. For example, if I think about the divisors of a prime number, in the positive integers, they are 1 and the number itself. But in integers, they are \u00b11 and \u00b1the number.\n\nTherefore, if the problem is in the context of integers, then the answer is 4. However, if it's in the context of positive integers, then 2. Since the problem says \"integer divisors,\" I think it's safer to go with 4. However, I need to check if there's a standard answer for this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a math competition where the answer is 2. For example, in the context of the AIME or AMC, they usually ask for positive divisors. However, since the problem is presented without context, I need to make a decision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a math textbook chapter that is discussing positive divisors. However, without that context, I can't be sure.\n\nBut given that the problem says \"integer divisors,\" and given that integers include negatives, I think the answer is 4. However, I need to check if there's a possibility that the problem is considering only positive divisors. For example, if the problem is in the context of the number of divisors function, which is usually defined for positive integers and counts positive divisors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a source where \"divisors\" are defined as positive integers. For example, in the definition of prime numbers, primes have exactly two positive divisors. Therefore, if the problem is following that convention, then the answer is 2.\n\nBut since the problem says \"integer divisors,\" not \"positive integer divisors,\" I think the answer is 4. However, I need to check if there's a way to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a math competition where the answer is 2. For example, if you look up similar problems, they usually ask for the number of positive divisors. For example, the number of divisors of 7 is 2. Therefore, maybe the answer is 2.\n\nBut since the problem says \"integer divisors,\" I think it's safer to answer 4. However, I need to check if there's a standard in mathematics. For example, in the OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences), the number of divisors is usually counted as positive. For example, the number of divisors function, denoted d(n), counts the number of positive divisors. Therefore, if the problem is referring to that function, then the answer is 2. However, if it's referring to all integer divisors, then it's 4.\n\nBut since the problem says \"integer divisors,\" and not \"positive integer divisors,\" I think the answer is 4. However, I need to check if there's a possibility that the problem is in a context where only positive divisors are considered. Given that 7 is a prime number, and primes have two positive divisors, which is a well-known fact, maybe the problem expects that answer.\n\nBut the problem says \"integer divisors,\" which is more general. However, maybe the problem is in a context where divisors are considered as positive. For example, in the context of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, divisors are positive. Therefore, if this is a problem from that context, the answer is 2.\n\nSince I don't have the context, but given that the problem is likely expecting a simple answer, and since 7 is prime, the answer is probably 2. However, I need to be precise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a math class where they have defined divisors as positive integers. Therefore, the answer is 2.\n\nBut since the problem says \"integer divisors,\" I think it's safer to answer 4. However, I need to check if there's a way to confirm. For example, if I think about the divisors of 1, they are \u00b11, so two divisors if considering positive, but four if considering integers. However, in most cases, the number of divisors of 1 is considered as 1, but that's if considering positive divisors. Wait, no, the positive divisors of 1 are just 1, so one positive divisor. If considering integers, then \u00b11, so two divisors.\n\nBut in most mathematical contexts, the number of divisors refers to positive divisors. Therefore, if the problem is following that convention, then the answer is 2. However, since the problem says \"integer divisors,\" which is more explicit, but maybe the answer is 2.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. Let me check online for similar problems. For example, if I search \"how many integer divisors does 7 have,\" what comes up? Well, I can't actually search, but based on my knowledge, in most cases, the number of divisors refers to positive divisors. For example, the number of divisors of a number n is usually given as the number of positive integers that divide n. Therefore, in that case, the answer is 2.\n\nHowever, if the problem specifically says \"integer divisors,\" then it's possible that they want both positive and negative. But since the problem is likely expecting a simple answer, and given that 7 is prime, the answer is probably 2.\n\nBut to be thorough, let me think again. If I consider all integer divisors, then for any integer n, the divisors are \u00b11, \u00b1n, and any other factors. For prime numbers, there are no other factors. Therefore, the integer divisors of 7 are -7, -1, 1, 7. That's four divisors. However, if the problem is in a context where divisors are considered positive, then it's two.\n\nBut since the problem says \"integer divisors,\" I think the answer is 4. However, I need to check if there's a standard in mathematics. For example, in the definition of a divisor, it's often stated that divisors can be negative. For example, in the Wikipedia article on divisors, it says: \"In mathematics, a divisor of an integer n, also called a factor of n, is an integer m that may be multiplied by some integer to produce n.\" So, for example, -1 is a divisor of 7 because (-1) * (-7) = 7. Therefore, according to this definition, there are four integer divisors of 7.\n\nHowever, in many mathematical problems, especially in number theory, when they ask for the number of divisors, they are referring to positive divisors. For example, the function \u03c4(n) (tau function) counts the number of positive divisors of n. Therefore, if the problem is referring to that function, the answer is 2. But if it's referring to all integer divisors, then it's 4.\n\nSince the problem says \"integer divisors,\" I think it's safer to go with 4. However, given that the problem might be from a source that assumes positive divisors, I'm a bit conflicted.\n\nBut since the problem is presented in isolation, and given that the term \"integer divisors\" is used, I think the answer is 4. Therefore, I will go with 4 as the number of integer divisors of 7.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If I consider that divisors are usually considered in the context of positive integers unless otherwise specified, even if the problem says \"integer divisors.\" For example, if someone says \"how many divisors does 7 have,\" they usually mean positive divisors. The term \"integer\" might be redundant here, but maybe it's emphasizing that we are considering integers, not fractions or something else. In that case, the answer would still be 2, because the positive integers are a subset of integers, and the question is about divisors, which are integers.\n\nBut if the question is about integer divisors, then technically, it's including negative integers. However, in common usage, people might still mean positive divisors.

        "full_steered_output":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many integer divisors the number 7 has. Let me start by recalling what a divisor is. A divisor of a number is an integer that divides that number without leaving a remainder. So, for example, 2 is a divisor of 4 because 4 divided by 2 is 2, which is an integer. But 3 isn't a divisor of 4 because 4 divided by 3 is not an integer.\n\nNow, the number in question here is 7. Let me think about the divisors of 7. Well, first, I know that 1 is a divisor of every number because any number divided by 1 is itself. So 1 is definitely a divisor of 7. Similarly, the number itself, which is 7, is also a divisor of 7 because 7 divided by 7 is 1, which is an integer.\n\nNow, are there any other divisors? Let me check. Let's consider numbers between 1 and 7. Let's test each one:\n\n- 2: 7 divided by 2 is 3.5, which is not an integer. So 2 is not a divisor.\n- 3: 7 divided by 3 is approximately 2.333... Not an integer. Not a divisor.\n- 4: 7 divided by 4 is 1.75. Nope.\n- 5: 7 divided by 5 is 1.4. Still not an integer.\n- 6: 7 divided by 6 is about 1.166... Not an integer.\n\nSo none of the numbers between 2 and 6 divide 7 evenly. What about numbers larger than 7? Well, if I take 8, 9, etc., dividing 7 by those numbers would result in fractions less than 1, which aren't integers. So those aren't divisors either.\n\nBut wait, do I need to consider negative integers as well? The problem says \"integer divisors,\" and integers include both positive and negative numbers. So, for example, -1 and -7 would also divide 7 because 7 divided by -1 is -7, which is an integer, and 7 divided by -7 is -1, which is also an integer.\n\nSo, if I include negative divisors, then the divisors of 7 would be -7, -1, 1, and 7. That's four divisors. But hold on, sometimes when people ask for the number of divisors, they might be referring to positive divisors only. Let me check the problem statement again. It says \"integer divisors,\" which technically includes both positive and negative. However, in mathematics, sometimes the term \"divisors\" can be context-dependent. For example, in number theory, divisors are often considered positive unless stated otherwise.\n\nBut the problem specifically says \"integer divisors,\" so maybe they want all integers, positive and negative. However, I need to be careful here. Let me think again. If we consider the definition, a divisor of an integer n is an integer m such that there exists an integer k where n = m*k. So, for example, both 1 and -1 divide 7 because 7 = 1*7 and 7 = (-1)*(-7). Similarly, 7 and -7 divide 7 because 7 = 7*1 and 7 = (-7)*(-1). Therefore, the integer divisors of 7 are indeed -7, -1, 1, and 7. That's four divisors.\n\nBut wait, sometimes in problems like this, unless specified otherwise, they might be asking for positive divisors. Let me check if there's a standard convention. In many math problems, especially in contexts like the number of divisors of a number, it's usually referring to positive divisors. For example, when we talk about the number of divisors of a number in the context of prime factorization or something like that, it's typically positive integers. However, the problem here says \"integer divisors,\" which is more explicit. So if we take it literally, it's all integers, positive and negative.\n\nBut maybe the problem is from a source where they consider only positive divisors. Let me think. For example, if this is a problem from a math competition or a textbook chapter that's discussing positive divisors, then the answer might be 2. However, if it's from a context where negative divisors are considered, then the answer is 4.\n\nWait, but let me check the exact wording again. The problem says \"How many integer divisors does 7 have?\" The term \"integer divisors\" is a bit ambiguous. However, in mathematics, the term \"divisor\" can refer to both positive and negative integers unless restricted. However, in many cases, especially in problems like this, unless specified, they might be referring to positive divisors. For example, when you look up the number of divisors of a number, it's usually the positive ones. For example, the number 7 is a prime number, and it has two positive divisors: 1 and 7. If negative divisors are included, then it's four.\n\nBut since the problem says \"integer divisors,\" which includes negatives, but maybe the answer expected is 2. However, I need to be precise here. Let me check with definitions.\n\nAccording to mathematical definitions, a divisor of an integer n is an integer m such that n divided by m is an integer. So, for example, the divisors of 7 are all integers m where 7\/m is an integer. So m can be 1, -1, 7, -7. Therefore, there are four integer divisors.\n\nBut maybe the problem is in a context where only positive divisors are considered. However, since the problem says \"integer divisors,\" not \"positive integer divisors,\" I think the answer should be 4. However, I need to check if there's a standard in math problems. For example, in the context of the GRE or SAT or other standardized tests, when they ask for the number of divisors, they usually mean positive divisors. However, since the problem is presented in a more general way, perhaps from a math competition or a general math problem, it's safer to consider both positive and negative.\n\nBut let me think again. If the problem is from a source that is following the standard mathematical definition, then the answer is 4. However, if it's following a convention where divisors are positive, then the answer is 2. Since the problem says \"integer divisors,\" I think it's safer to go with the mathematical definition which includes negatives. However, I need to check if there's a way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the context of the positive integers. For example, in the context of the number of divisors function, which is usually defined for positive integers and counts positive divisors. However, the problem says \"integer divisors,\" which is more general.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a math competition like the AMC, where usually divisors are considered positive unless stated otherwise. For example, in the AMC problems, when they ask for the number of divisors, they mean positive divisors. Therefore, if this is similar, the answer would be 2.\n\nBut since the problem is presented in isolation, without context, I need to make an educated guess. However, given that 7 is a prime number, and primes have exactly two positive divisors, 1 and themselves. Therefore, if the problem is following that convention, the answer is 2. However, if negative divisors are considered, then it's 4.\n\nBut the problem says \"integer divisors,\" so maybe the answer is 4. However, I need to check if there's a standard in mathematics.

But in integers, they are \u00b11 and \u00b1the number.\n\nTherefore, if the problem is in the context of integers, then the answer is 4. However, if it's in the context of positive integers, then 2. Since the problem says \"integer divisors,\" I think it's safer to go with 4. However, I need to check if there's a standard answer for this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a math competition where the answer is 2. For example, in the context of the AIME or AMC, they usually ask for positive divisors. However, since the problem is presented without context, I need to make a decision.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a math textbook chapter that is discussing positive divisors. However, without that context, I can't be sure.\n\nBut given that the problem says \"integer divisors,\" and given that integers include negatives, I think the answer is 4.

For example, if the problem is in the context of the number of divisors function, which is usually defined for positive integers and counts positive divisors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a source where \"divisors\" are defined as positive integers.

For example, in the OEIS (Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences), the number of divisors is usually counted as positive. For example, the number of divisors function, denoted d(n), counts the number of positive divisors. Therefore, if the problem is referring to that function, then the answer is 2.

However, maybe the problem is in a context where divisors are considered as positive. For example, in the context of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, divisors are positive. Therefore, if this is a problem from that context, the answer is 2.\n\nSince I don't have the context, but given that the problem is likely expecting a simple answer, and since 7 is prime, the answer is probably 2.

Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem. She starts on the 6th floor. Each flip, she moves up or down. She does this five times, making five stops. Each of these five stops must be on the 7th floor or higher. So, even if she goes down, she can't go below the 7th floor at any point during these five moves. Wait, but she starts on the 6th floor. Wait, but the first move is after the first flip. So, starting at 6th floor, then after first flip, she goes to 5th or 7th. But the problem says each of her next five stops is on the 7th floor or higher. So, does that mean that after each of the five moves, she must be on 7th or higher? So even the first move must not take her below 7th? But she starts on 6th. So if she flips tails on the first flip, she would go to 5th floor, which is below 7th. Therefore, that would be invalid. Therefore, the first move must be heads, taking her to 7th floor. Then, for the subsequent moves, she must not go below 7th floor. Wait, but the problem says \"each of her next five stops is on the 7th floor or higher.\" So each of the five stops after the initial one? Or does it include the starting floor? Wait, the problem says \"each of her next five stops.\" So starting from the 6th floor, she makes five stops. So the first stop is after the first flip, the second stop after the second flip, etc., up to the fifth stop. Therefore, each of these five stops must be on the 7th floor or higher. Therefore, starting at 6th floor, after first move, she must be on 7th or higher. Therefore, first move must be heads (up to 7th). Then, for the subsequent moves, she must not go below 7th floor. So this seems like a problem related to restricted walks or something like that. Maybe similar to the ballot problem?",

Since starting at sixth floor, which is equivalent to being displaced by -1 from the seventh floor. The requirement is that throughout the entire walk, the cumulative displacement never drops below 0 (i.e., stays non-negative when considering distance from seventh floor). However, since initially, she is at -1, how do we reconcile that?\n\nHmm, actually no\u2014wait. If she needs every stopping place to be on the 7th floor or higher, i.e., floor number f_i \u2265 7 where f_0 = 6, and f_k = 6 + sum_{j=1}^k X_j, where X_j \u2208 {+1,-1}. Thus, requiring that for k=1,...,5, f_k \u2265 7 \u21d2 6 + S_k \u2265 7 \u21d2 S_k \u2265 1, where S_k is the partial sum after k steps. Hence, our condition becomes that all partial sums S_1 through S_5 are \u2265 1. Starting from S_0 = 0 (if we consider the original position before moving... wait hold on.)\n\nActually, more accurately, the process begins at floor 6. After flipping once, she has moved either +1 or -1, resulting in floor numbers 7 or 5 respectively. For each of those five movements, the final floor must be \u22657. That means that after each movement (after each flip), regardless of previous ones, the result should be \u22657. Which implies that after each individual flip sequence, the total change must bring her back to \u22657. \n\nBut given that she starts at 6, the net effect over n steps is such that 6 + [number_of_heads - number_of_tails] \u2265 7. Also, note that because there are exactly five steps, number_of_heads + number_of_tails = 5. Let H be #Heads, T=#Tails. Then H-T = D, so 6 + D \u2265 7 \u2192 D \u2265 1",

But the problem says each of her next five stops is on the 7th floor or higher. So, does that mean that after each of the five moves, she must be on 7th or higher? So even the first move must not take her below 7th? But she starts on 6th. So if she flips tails on the first flip, she would go to 5th floor, which is below 7th. Therefore, that would be invalid. Therefore, the first move must be heads, taking her to 7th floor. Then, for the subsequent moves, she must not go below 7th floor. Wait, but the problem says \"each of her next five stops is on the 7th floor or higher.\" So each of the five stops after the initial one? Or does it include the starting floor? Wait, the problem says \"each of her next five stops.\" So starting from the 6th floor, she makes five stops. So the first stop is after the first flip, the second stop after the second flip, etc., up to the fifth stop. Therefore, each of these five stops must be on the 7th floor or higher. Therefore, starting at 6th floor, after first move, she must be on 7th or higher. Therefore, first move must be heads (up to 7th). Then, for the subsequent moves, she must not go below 7th floor. So this seems like a problem related to restricted walks or something like that. Maybe similar to the ballot problem? Where you have certain constraints on staying above zero?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model this as paths with specific conditions. Let's formalize:\n\nLet\u2019s denote that each step is +1 (heads) or -1 (tails), starting at position x=0 (since current floor is 6; target floors are >=7, meaning relative positions: start at 0, want all steps to stay \u2265+1).\n\nWait, perhaps better to reframe everything in terms of displacement from the seventh floor. Since starting at sixth floor, which is equivalent to being displaced by -1 from the seventh floor. The requirement is that throughout the entire walk, the cumulative displacement never drops below 0 (i.e., stays non-negative when considering distance from seventh floor). However, since initially, she is at -1, how do we reconcile that?\n\nHmm, actually no\u2014wait. If she needs every stopping place to be on the 7th floor or higher, i.e., floor number f_i \u2265 7 where f_0 = 6, and f_k = 6 + sum_{j=1}^k X_j, where X_j \u2208 {+1,-1}. Thus, requiring that for k=1,...,5, f_k \u2265 7 \u21d2 6 + S_k \u2265 7 \u21d2 S_k \u2265 1, where S_k is the partial sum after k steps. Hence, our condition becomes that all partial sums S_1 through S_5 are \u2265 1. Starting from S_0 = 0 (if we consider the original position before moving... wait hold on.)\n\nActually, more accurately, the process begins at floor 6. After flipping once, she has moved either +1 or -1, resulting in floor numbers 7 or 5 respectively. For each of those five movements, the final floor must be \u22657. That means that after each movement (after each flip), regardless of previous ones, the result should be \u22657. Which implies that after each individual flip sequence, the total change must bring her back to \u22657. \n\nBut given that she starts at 6, the net effect over n steps is such that 6 + [number_of_heads - number_of_tails] \u2265 7. Also, note that because there are exactly five steps, number_of_heads + number_of_tails = 5. Let H be #Heads, T=#Tails. Then H-T = D, so 6 + D \u2265 7 \u2192 D \u2265 1",
